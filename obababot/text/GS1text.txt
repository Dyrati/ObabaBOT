The four elements are{3}the basic building{3}blocks of all matter.{1}The elemental spirits{3}are called Djinn.{1}The four elements are{3}Venus for Earth,{3}Mercury for Water,{1}Mars for Fire, and{3}Jupiter for Wind.{1}Each element has many{3}Djinn.
When you set a Djinni, its{3}elemental power may{3}change your class{1}or Psynergy. In battle,{3}you can unleash the{3}powers of set Djinn.
When a Djinni is standing{3}by, you can use it{3}to summon in battle.{1}To use a summon{3}immediately, put your{3}Djinn on standby before{1}battle. But be careful,{3}because changing set{3}Djinn to standby changes{1}your class and Psynergy.
If you have a standby{3}Djinni in battle, you{3}can use it to summon.{1}After summoning, the{3}Djinni will be in{3}recovery until it has{1}recovered all its{3}power. Recovering Djinni{3}cannot be unleashed{1}or used to summon.
If a Djinni's power is{3}used to summon, the{3}Djinni enters recovery.{1}After it has recovered{3}its power, it will set{3}itself once again.
When a Djinni is set to{3}an Adept, its power{3}may change the Adept's{1}class. Find your own{3}unique combinations of{3}Djinni to improve your{1}characters' classes.
Psynergy is a mental{3}power. People who wield{3}it are called Adepts.{1}Psynergy can change{3}with class changes or{3}when you go up a level.{1}Try changing your{3}class to earn new{3}Psynergy.
To give your Djinni to{3}someone else, move it{3}like this.{2}
After choosing who will{3}take the Djinni, you{3}can set it.{2}
When your class changes,{3}the Psynergy you can use{3}may also change.{2}
Setting a Djinni changes{3}your attributes and{3}maybe even your class.{2}
Each Djinni has{3}different powers.{30}
Once we are set, you{3}can unleash us to{3}use our powers.{30}
So, let me demonstrate{3}the power of my attack,{3}{17}{1}.{30}
See! When you unleashed{3}me, I attacked with my{3}mighty stone-cleaver!{2}
After being unleashed,{3}we Djinn will then{3}stand by to be summoned...{30}
If you have standby{3}Djinn, you can summon{3}even greater powers!{30}
Choose this command{3}to unleash me in{3}battle, OK?{30}
Then you can summon{3}even greater powers!{30}
After a Djinni has been{3}used to summon, it must{3}spend time in recovery.{2}
And after we recover, we{3}will set ourselves again{3}and be ready to attack.{2}
That's all you have to do{3}to unleash a set Djinni!{2}
Oh!{2}
A traveling warrior!{2}
And I see you're an{3}Adept, too!{2}
You are just the kind{3}of fighter that I've{3}been looking for.{2}
Won't you please take{3}me along with you?{2}
I am a Venus Djinni.{3}My name is {8}{5}{21}{8}{16}.{2}
I must find my comrades.{1}We were separated from{3}each other when the{3}volcano erupted.{2}
...Maybe you can help{3}gather my friends{3}together as you travel.{2}
If you let me join you,{3}I'll prove to be very{3}beneficial to you Adepts!{2}
Your Psynergy will grow{3}stronger, and your Adept{3}skills will also improve.{2}
You can call on us in{3}battle or just use our{3}power to boost your own!{2}
If you call on many of{3}us at once, our powers{3}will work together!{2}
What do you think? Will{3}you take me with you?{30}
Come on! I promise you{3}won't regret it! Please{3}take me with you!{30}
Pleeeease! I'll never{3}let you down. Can't I go{3}with you?{30}
No, I'm serious! I'll{3}never, ever disappoint{3}you. Please!!!{30}
P{5}{5}LEASE{5} take me {5}with{3}you!{5} Please! {5}I'm begging!{30}
Please!{30}
Take me with you!{30}
Meanie!{1}I don't care what you{3}say! I'm coming along{3}with you!{2}
Oh, you'll see!{3}You won't regret it!{2}
{8}{5}{21}{8}{16}, the Venus Djinni,{3}is now {17}{1}'s ally!{2}
Now, I'll briefly teach{3}you how to use{3}Djinn.{2}
After bringing a Djinni{3}into your party, you must{3}set it to somebody.{2}
Next, I'll show you how{3}you can use us in{3}battle.{2}
See! We Djinn can be{3}very useful, can't we?{2}
And one more thing...{2}
So, we go from set{3}to standby to recovery,{3}then back to set.{2}
This is the simplest{3}way to use us.{2}
Did you get all that?{30}
Hmmmm,{5} shall I explain{3}it all to you again?{30}
Well, then, I guess{3}I'll start from the{3}beginning, OK?{2}
Oh, yeah! If you want to{3}learn more about Djinn,{3}refer to the help, OK?{2}
Okay, I'll join you now.{3}Thank you very much!{1}Please, use us{3}Djinn wisely.{2}

Lucky Dice{1}Throw the dice on the{3}table and try to get{3}the same numbers.{1}Prizes are based on{3}the numbers rolled and{3}where each die lands.{1}The more numbers{3}that match, the more you{3}win.{2}
Lucky Dice{1}If two numbers match on{3}either the dice or{3}the table...{1}it's called a pair,{3}and you don't win or{3}lose anything.{1}Two pair doubles your{3}money. Triple matches{3}triple your money.{1}Four of a kind is{3}perfect, and you win{3}five times your bet.{1}Plus, if your dice come{3}up perfect on the{3}Perfect Bonus spot{1}on the table,{3}you win an even{3}bigger bonus!{2}
Ya won {22} coin{25}!{3}Talk about lucky!{2}
Ya lost {22} coin{25}.{3}Better luck next time.{2}
Is this yer first{3}time to play{3}Lucky Dice?{30}
Once ya start playing,{3}ya won't want to stop.{1}There's no other game{3}in all the lands that's{3}this much fun.{2}
Lucky Dice is all the{3}rage in Tolbi. You can{3}play it year-round.{2}
Whoa! Getting triple{3}digits is real tough!{2}
I don't want to stop{3}playing Lucky Dice, but{3}I can't spend anymore!{2}
Winning or losing{3}is pure luck. I ain't{3}cheatin' nobody.{2}
The rules for Lucky Dice{3}ain't all that hard.{1}Ya can even learn{3}'em while ya play.{2}
Sometimes, people who{3}have never played{3}Lucky Dice win the most.{1}They call that{3}beginner's luck.{2}
Thinking won't help{3}you win this game.{3}When I try to think{1}about how to throw the{3}dice, I lose. Maybe{3}I think too much.{2}
My luck has run out{3}for today. I better{3}quit playing.{2}

You can't carry any more{3}items. Are you sure{3}you want to play?{30}
If you win anything,{3}you might not be able{3}to take it with you.{1}Is that okay?{30}
Then get rid of some{3}items and come{3}again.{2}
Step right up and enjoy{3}yourself.{2}
Choose how many{3}tickets you'll use.{2}
Are you ready to quit?{30}
Now, we'll start{3}round {22}.{2}
Congratulations!{2}
You won {20}{2}!{3}Here you go.{2}
And you won{3}{20}{2}!{3}Here you go.{2}

Too bad...{3}Come back after you{3}get some tickets.{2}
Too bad...{1}Would you like to use{3}your tickets to{3}keep playing?{30}

Lucky Wheels Prizes{1}Prizes are determined{3}by which icons you match.{1}Shirts win undershirts,{3}Rings win rings,{3}Boots win boots,{1}Stars and Hearts win{3}items, and Moons can win{3}you anything.{2}
Face away from Tolbi{3}Spring and toss a{3}coin into it.{1}If you get lucky,{3}something good will{3}happen.{2}
If you toss a Lucky{3}Medal and you get{3}really lucky,{1}you'll get a better{3}prize than you{3}would with a coin.{2}
Tolbi Spring has{3}mysterious powers.{1}Stand with your back to{3}the spring, and throw{3}a coin at the target!{2}
Do you have{3}a Lucky Medal?{30}
Oh, you do?{3}How.{5}.{5}.lucky!{1}That means you'll be{3}extra lucky if you toss{3}it in the fountain!{2}
Hmm... If I were going{3}to try my luck, I'd want{3}to use a Lucky Medal.{2}
Too bad I only{3}have one Lucky Medal.{1}I don't want to risk losing{3}it if I miss, since it's{3}my only one...{2}
Hmm? Do you want{3}to test your luck{3}at Tolbi Spring?{30}
Oh, you don't?{3}Well, I'm just going to{3}keep trying for a while.{2}
Really? Well then, I'll give{3}you the chance to go{3}first.{2}
Ah... I guess I just don't{3}have very much luck.{3}How about you?{2}
I keep losing coins,{3}but I just can't stop!{3}What's wrong with me?{2}
Would you like to{3}challenge Tolbi Spring?{30}
What will you throw?{30}
You don't have any coins!{2}
You have no Lucky Medals!{2}
You won{3}{22} coin{25}!{2}

I get nervous when I toss{3}coins backward. I wish{3}I could face forward...{2}
Why won't anyone{3}give me a Lucky Medal?{2}
This is a Lucky Medal,{3}so it should be OK{3}if I miss by a bit.{1}I need all the{3}good luck I can get.{2}
Hmm... I wonder if{3}these kids will take{3}all the best items...{2}
{17}{1}, wake up!{2}
Please, dear, wake up!{2}
The Mt. Aleph Boulder{3}is going to fall!{2}
Come on, {17}{1}.{3}We have to go{24}now!{2}
{17}{1}! You forgot{3}something!{2}
It's pouring outside!{3}Don't go out without{3}your tunic!{2}
Have you got{3}everything you need?{30}
I'm sorry, but we{3}don't have time... You'll{3}have to leave it behind.{2}
Good for you, {17}{1}.{3}A lost possession can be{3}replaced; a lost life can't.{2}
{17}{1}, Dora, hurry!{3}The Boulder could{3}fall at any second!{2}
Kyle... Will they be able{3}to stop the Boulder?{2}
I don't think so...{3}Not for long, anyway...{2}
You two go on ahead and{3}take refuge in the plaza.{2}
Aren't you coming?{2}
I need to help evacuate{3}the other villagers.{2}
Let me help you, Kyle!{2}
It's too dangerous, Dora.{3}Please, just take good{3}care of {17}{1}!{2}
{17}{1} is old enough to get{3}to the plaza on his own.{2}
You can find your{3}way, can't you,{3}{17}{1}?{30}
You're a big boy{3}now, {17}{1}. Why don't you go{3}on your own?{30}
You know the way{24}just{3}go south to get to{3}the plaza. Be careful!{2}
Huh? {17}{1}?{2}
Did you come to get me?{30}
Oh... {5}Sorry to shove you{3}like that.{2}
This isn't the time for{3}games! Foolish boy!{2}
Well...{5}we'd better get{3}to the plaza before{3}the Boulder hits.{2}
{9}{4}Ugh... {5}Hrnghhh... {2}
{17}{1}, what do you want?{3}I'm trying to{3}save my things!{2}
What, you want me to{3}just dump my stuff?
I guess dragging a heavy{3}chest around like this{3}isn't very safe...{2}
You know, you're right.{3}OK!{5} Let's get out of{3}here!{2}
You're not just going to{3}leave me here, are you,{3}{17}{1}?{30}
I guess dragging a heavy{3}chest like this around{3}isn't very safe...{2}
You know, you're right.{3}OK!{5} Let's get out of{3}here!{2}
Hey! {17}{1}!{2}
*Hah* {5}*Hah*{2}
Are you trapped, too?{30}
Hmph!{5} It's not like you to{3}be caught unprepared,{3}{17}{1}.{2}
Oh, you got held up{3}seeing off the elders who{3}went to help the others!{2}
You came just in time...{3}We can go together.{2}
Everyone's gathering down{3}south, in the town plaza.{2}
We shouldn't go north...{3}that'll take us toward{3}Mt. Aleph.{2}
The plaza is over that{3}way. We need to head{3}south.{2}
We can't get around{3}this rock!{2}
We'll have to find{3}another way.{2}
{9}{4}Ahhh! The Boulder!{3}It's falling!{2}
{9}{4}Ugh...{5} Ughnn...{5}{5}{3}It's too heavy!{5}{3}We can't hold it for long!{2}
If our Psynergy runs out,{3}Vale will be destroyed!{2}
{9}{4}We have to hold on until{3}the villagers are safe!{2}
Hurry, boys!{5} Run!!!{3}It's just a little farther!{2}
Come on, {17}{1}, run!{3}The Boulder is coming!{2}
Rockslide...destroyed{3}fence... Monsters{3}everywhere...{2}
I'm{5} hurt pretty badly...{3}Do you think I'll die?{30}
I knew it...{5}{3}This is it for me.{3}Save yourselves...{2}
This is awful.{3}I'm left here for{3}the monsters to...{2}
Wait... That's strange...{5}{3}I'm not hurt at all!{2}
But I'm serious about the{3}monsters, so be careful{3}on your way to the plaza!{2}
This is it for me.{3}Save yourselves...{2}
Oh no! My brother!{2}
Hang on, {17}{5}!{2}
{17}{5} will be all{3}right. We'll find a{3}way to save him...{2}
{9}{4}Nooooo!{5} {17}{5}!{2}
The rope won't reach...{3}We should use Psynergy.{3}Do you have any left?{2}
I've used all mine up.{3}What about you, Kyle?{2}
I'm drained from helping{3}the other villagers...{2}
We have to get help.{2}
Can {17}{5} hang on{3}long enough for us to{3}find help?{2}
There's nothing else{3}we can do for him{3}here,{5} is there?{2}
Then go get help, but be{3}as quick as possible!{2}
{17}{6}, can you go too?{2}
You'll go find help, right?{2}
Your brother's counting{3}on you, {17}{6}.{2}
All right,{3}let's get going!{2}
I'll go look up north...{3}You head for the plaza,{3}all right?{2}
Yes, ma'am. We're looking{3}for anyone with any{3}Psynergy left, right?{2}
{17}{1}!{2}
You saw what happened?{30}
I have to go get help{3}before {17}{5} drowns!{2}
I'm looking for someone{3}who can help {17}{5}.{3}He's fallen into the river.{2}
I don't suppose...{5}{3}Could the two of{3}you help me?{30}
{17}{6} has gone to the{3}plaza to get help.{3}Go join her.{2}
You don't have to if you{3}don't want to...{5} Just get{3}yourselves to the plaza.{2}
Oh, {17}{1}...{2}
You two don't have enough{3}Psynergy to save {17}{5}.{3}Go find help.{2}
Hang on, {17}{5}!{3}Help is on the way!{2}
Don't let go, {17}{5}!{2}
Huh?{5} Are you...asking me{3}if I can use Psynergy,{3}{17}{1}?{30}
If I were ten years{3}younger, I'd have plenty{3}to offer, but I'm too old...{2}
I thought not... You have{3}to be young and strong{3}to use Psynergy...{2}
You expect an old woman{3}like me to use Psynergy?{1}Don't ask the impossible!{2}
{9}{4}Ohhh...{7} I'm exhausted.{1}I used up all my Psynergy{3}deflecting falling rocks...{2}
Oh!{5} Little {17}{5} has{3}fallen into the river?{1}That must be why {17}{6}{3}looked so upset.{2}
I have some Psynergy{3}left.{2}
See?{1}Isn't that impressive!?{2}
{17}{6} went off that way!{2}
Be sure to help {17}{5}.{2}
Do you know what became{3}of the boulder that fell{3}from Mt. Aleph?{30}
What?{5} It's falling toward{3}the village? The elders{3}are holding it back?!?{1}They are the most{3}powerful Psynergy Adepts{3}in Vale.{2}
They said the Boulder{3}would have to fall{3}sometime...{1}I just knew a storm like{3}this would knock it loose!{2}
{17}{6} asked me to help{3}{17}{5}.{1}If I didn't have to use{3}Psynergy, I'd help in an{3}instant!{2}
Go aid the elders! The{3}Boulder is too heavy for{3}them to hold much longer.{2}
We can't let the Mt.{3}Aleph Boulder destroy{3}our village.{2}
Let's go help the{3}elders.{2}
We're counting on you.{2}
Grandpa! {17}{6}!{2}
{17}{2}, {17}{1}...{3}You came to help me?{2}
{17}{6} told me about{3}{17}{5}. Is that{3}why you're here?{30}
Well, regardless,{5} I{3}want you two to help{3}{17}{6}.{2}
Good boys!{3}{17}{6} could{3}use a hand.{2}
Great!{5} I'm all charged up!{2}
How are you?{5} Have you{3}recovered your Psynergy?{2}
Enough to save {17}{5},{3}thanks to the Psynergy{3}Stone.{2}
OK, {17}{6}, you heard{3}him. Now hurry back!{2}
The path may be blocked{3}by fallen rocks. You two{3}can show them the way!{2}
...Thank you, {17}{1}.{2}
We're in a race against{3}time! You must hurry!{2}
Mom! Dad!{5} We're back!{2}
Is that you, {17}{6}?{2}
Yes, ma'am...{2}
I couldn't find anyone{3}who could help...{1}How did you do?{2}
You're just in time.{2}
Then my brother is{3}still...{2}
{17}{5} is all right.{5}{3}He's hanging in there.{2}
Come down here, so{3}we can save {17}{5}!{2}
No...{5} It can't be. Kyle...{3}It must be a dream...{2}
Mom, Dad...{5} {17}{5}...{5}{5}{3}Please...{5} Don't leave me{3}all alone...{2}
{17}{1}... The Boulder...{5}{5}{3}We need to get help,{3}or everyone will drown...{2}
{9}{4}Oh,{5} ohhh...{5} I...{3}I'll go!{2}
{9}{4}It's no use.{5} I can't move...{5}{5}{3}{17}{1}, please get help!{2}
{17}{1}...{2}
I can't let him{3}go alone...{2}
It's times like these{3}that we men have to{3}stand together!{2}
Only the two of us{3}survived...{2}
How could we have{3}anticipated Sol Sanctum{3}would unleash such fury?{2}
It's a miracle that even{3}the two of us were{3}spared...{2}
That switch...{5}{3}It must have{3}been a trap...{2}
But to think it could{3}conjure up a storm{3}this powerful!{2}
...Another demonstration{3}of the awesome powers{3}of Alchemy.{2}
Regardless, we must not{3}fail the next time we{3}challenge Sol Sanctum.{2}
Next time,{5} we shall{3}certainly...{2}
{17}{1}! Wait!{2}
You were eavesdropping{3}on us just now...{3}weren't you?{30}
{17}{1}...{2}
{17}{1}{5}, they look{3}scary...{1}Are you sure you should{3}be talking to them?{2}
You must forget{3}everything you heard.{2}
Don't worry...{3}We'll help you forget!{2}
The door won't open.{1}The force of the impact{3}must have knocked it off{3}its hinges.{2}
You think I should{3}forget these things and{3}save my own life?{2}
Hmm... If a rock hits me{3}now, I'll lose both my{3}chest and my life.{2}
You're right{24}I should{3}just ditch my stuff.{3}Let's get out of here.{2}
Three years later...{2}
{17}{1}! Haven't you{3}finished mending the roof{3}yet?{2}
You're almost done?{3}OK! Keep at it!{2}
Hyaa!{2}
Hee hee...{3}Still training, {17}{2}?{2}
Hyaaaa!{2}
You sure do put your{3}heart into it, {17}{2}!{2}
Oh, I'm just finishing up.{2}
That's good. It's time to{3}go, and I was about{3}to leave you behind.{2}
Say,{5} what exactly{3}happened to you two?{2}
The accident three years{3}ago...{5} Is that why you've{3}been studying Psynergy?{2}
I appreciate your concern,{3}but...my family's never{3}coming back,{1}{5}and neither is {17}{1}{27}{3}father...{2}
I just want to forget{3}that day.{5} I wish{3}everyone would...{2}
That awful day... We went{3}to get help, but they{3}found us unconscious...{30}
Well, let's get {17}{1}{3}and go to Kraden's...{30}
What, {17}{2}?{2}
Huh?{5} You were about to{3}say something, weren't{3}you?{2}
Don't be weird, {17}{2}!{2}
Whatever...{2}
{17}{6},{5} are you mad at me?{2}
I don't want to{3}talk about it.{2}
Come on!!!{2}
Huh?{2}
{17}{1}'s waiting for us.{2}
But, {17}{6}...!{2}
I'll leave you behind{3}if you're too slow.{2}
{17}{6}...{2}
Good job, {17}{1}.{2}
You patched it nicely.{2}
All right. You're all done.{2}
You're very reliable,{3}{17}{1}...just like your{3}father was.{2}
What is it, {17}{1}? Do{3}you still think about{3}the accident?{30}
I don't believe you...{2}
I thought so... {17}{1}...{2}
You and {17}{2} have been{3}working yourselves to the{3}bone studying Psynergy.{2}
Do you think things would{3}be any different if you'd{3}had stronger abilities?{30}
That's what I thought.{2}
Hmmm...{5} I wonder...{2}
I was devastated when{3}Kyle died...{2}
I felt all alone...{2}
It's taken some time, but{5}{3}I'm better now.{2}
I still have you,{5} {17}{1}.{2}
You're almost seventeen.{3}You're so much like Kyle{3}was when he was young.{2}
I'm looking forward to{3}seeing where life takes{3}you.{2}
MA'{5}AAAAM!!!{2}
Hello, {17}{6}.{2}
Good morning.{2}
Yes, yes... Good morning.{2}
Well, if it isn't {17}{2},{3}too!{2}
Where do you all plan{3}to go today?{2}
We're going to Mt.{3}Aleph with Kraden.{2}
Mountain climbing{3}with Kraden, eh?{2}
Kids and their games...{2}
No!{5} It's part of our{3}studies...{2}
Ah, yes... Alchemy.{2}
Alchemy is the foundation{3}of all Psynergy...{2}
And you all know Mt.{3}Aleph is the greatest{3}source of Alchemy.{2}
They say Kraden is the{3}best teacher around.{2}
Alchemy... I wonder what{3}use it all is?{2}
Your mother would rather{3}see you grow up to be{3}a happy, ordinary man.{2}
But I suppose you{3}still want to go...{30}
Well, if that won't{3}persuade you, I guess{3}nothing will!{2}
It's nice of you to humor{3}me, but I know you{3}don't mean it.{2}
You're just as stubborn{3}as your father!{2}
Ahhh!{1}
Be careful, ma'am!
{17}{2}, don't!{2}
Oh! That was exciting!{2}
I'm sorry I scared you{3}like that.{2}
Well!{2}
I...{5} I'm sorry, ma'am.{3}I'll get out of your way{3}right away!{2}
Wait! Not there!{2}
Huh?{5} What's wrong with{24}{2}
Oh, never mind...{2}
But you'd better{3}get going...{2}
This old house will fall{3}apart if you stay much{3}longer.{2}
I'll get this fixed up.{3}You don't have to{3}hang around here.{2}
Thank you, ma'am.{2}
Please, call me Dora.{2}
We'll get going{3}right away!{2}
Wait, {17}{2}...{5}{5}{3}Just{5} watch your step.{2}
Kraden is waiting for us.{3}We should go to his{3}house.{2}
Well, if it isn't {17}{1}.{3}It's just another quiet{3}day in Vale.{2}
Kraden had visitors{3}when I dropped by his{3}place this morning.{1}I wonder what became of{3}them...{2}
{16}! Have you{3}remembered to meditate{3}on Mt. Aleph daily?{30}
That's very good of you!{3}Meditating helps keep the{3}peace in the village.{1}If everyone were like you,{3}things would have gone{3}better three years ago!{2}
For shame, {16}!{3}Mt. Aleph keeps{3}watch over Vale.{1}Meditate each and{3}every day to help{3}keep us safe.{2}
You had a very difficult{3}time three years ago,{3}didn't you?{30}
You lost your father...{3}{17}{6} lost her whole{3}family...{5} It was awful.{1}At least {17}{6}{27}{3}grandparents have been{3}able to care for her...{2}
You're a strong lad,{3}{17}{1}, so you were able{3}to deal with it all...{1}But I just couldn't bear{3}seeing {17}{6} like{3}that.{2}
The Valeans are a{3}chosen people.{1}Our powers of Psynergy{3}are proof of that.{2}
Long ago, my grandfather{3}was a powerful Adept...{3}I'm so proud of him.{2}
Did the travelers that{3}stopped by today go{3}to meet the mayor?{30}
I told them where{3}Kraden lives, and they{3}didn't even thank me.{1}But I suppose they must{3}have some manners...{2}
It's very polite to{3}visit the mayor when{3}coming to a new town.{1}It's just shameful{3}not to do that.{2}
With Psynergy,{3}the more you practice,{3}the more you learn.{2}
Hey, {16}, have{3}I shown you my new{3}ability?{30}
It takes hard work to{3}reach this level of{3}mastery, {16}.{2}
Really? Well, here's{3}a little sample for you!{2}
Behold, the power of{3}Psynergy!{5} Hahh!{5}{3}Impressive, isn't it?{2}
If your Psynergy runs{3}low, just walk around.{3}You'll recover it slowly.{2}
Rrruff! Rrrruff!{2}
Woof! Woof!{2}
There are some puppies{3}playing over there.{1}We should let them be.{2}
Those who can wield{3}Psynergy are called{3}Adepts.{1}Adepts are the servants{3}of good.{3}Never forget that!{2}
Our Psynergy was given{3}to us by the divine power{3}of Mt. Aleph.{1}It's because of Psynergy{3}that our wishes can{3}be granted.{2}
Psynergy should be used{3}to create peace...{5} It must{3}not be used for evil!{2}
Good weapons aren't just{3}sharp. They also draw out{3}the strength of the user.{1}...So said my father. Do{3}you know what he meant,{3}{16}? I do...{2}
Good armor isn't just{3}sturdy. It also draws out{3}the strength of the user.{1}...That's what they{3}say, but I don't know{3}what it means...{2}
A wise man knows to{3}flee from battle{3}when he's injured.{2}
My father also died in{3}that storm three years{3}ago.{1}I'm going to hone my{3}skills...{5} That way, I'll be{3}ready for anything.{2}
My son is still young,{3}so I don't make him{3}work too long.{1}But he takes after his{3}father, so I'm sure he'll{3}grow to be a fine man.{2}
Those three travelers{3}staying here may not{3}be thieves,{1}but there's something{3}strange about them.{2}
One of the men from that{3}group staying here wore{3}a mask over his face.{1}I guess he was trying{3}to cover up some scars{3}or something...{2}
Two of those three{3}guests staying with us{3}have gone out.{2}
Hey...{5} Boy...{2}
Do you have business{3}with me?{30}
That's too bad, because{3}I have no business{3}with you. Be off!{2}
Then I suggest you stop{3}wasting my time.{2}
At the very least,{3}visitors should introduce{3}themselves to the mayor.{1}There seems to be an{3}appalling group in town{3}that won't even do that...{1}What's the world{3}coming to?{2}
I hear Kraden has guests{3}again. He's pretty{3}popular for a sage.{2}
{17}{2} has grown{3}quite strong in the{3}past three years.{1}Please watch over him.{2}
You and {17}{2} are older{3}now, and you can't waste{3}your time fooling around.{2}
{17}{2}, you make me{3}so mad sometimes!{2}
Your training stone{3}crushed my flowers!{2}
You're in for it tonight...{3}{5}Just {5}wait {5}and {5}see!{2}
I'll get you for my{3}flowers! {5}Just see{3}what happens.{5}.{5}.{5}tonight!{2}
You're in trouble now,{3}{17}{2}...{1}Your sister's really mad!{2}
I told that clumsy {17}{2}{3}it would be all right...{1}But what am I going to{3}do about this hole?{2}
It looks like it won't{3}rain for some time...{1}so I guess I'll just have{3}you fix it later, {17}{1}.{2}
My granddaughter, {17}{6},{3}is finally happy again...{1}I have you and {17}{2}{3}to thank for that, {17}{1}.{2}
I hope you two won't be{3}taking {17}{6} outside the{3}village with you.{2}
{17}{6} is the spitting{3}image of her mother,{3}whom we lost that day...{1}I just want {17}{6} to be{3}happy.{2}
So Kraden came to{3}Vale to study{3}Mt. Aleph, right?{30}
He said he was studying{3}Mt. Aleph and Alchemy{3}and the like...{1}Mt. Aleph... Alchemy...{3}Are they related{3}somehow?{2}
But I thought...{3}Well, whatever.{1}If he furthers the{3}wisdom of the sages, it{3}will be quite a feat.{2}
If there are visitors{3}in town, we can't use{3}our Psynergy.{1}The ancient laws say the{3}secret of Psynergy can{3}never be revealed.{2}
Do you ever dream of{3}seeing the world outside{3}the village?{1}Someday, I'm definitely{3}gonna leave Vale!{2}
Few people outside of{3}Vale possess the power{3}of Psynergy.{1}That's why we need{3}permission to leave the{3}village...{1}{5}...To protect the secret{3}of Psynergy.{2}
I hear old man Kraden's{3}got some visitors.{1}{5}Let's go use our Psynergy{3}to scare 'em!{30}
You're more of a{3}prankster than I thought,{3}{17}{1}. I like that.{2}
What? You're too serious,{3}{17}{1}...{1}{5}Only someone who has{3}Psynergy would figure{3}it out...{2}
Do you hear those awful{3}growls coming from the{3}other side of this fence?
You do, don't you?{3}{9}{4}I... I'm scared...{2}
Really? You mean I'm the{3}only one that hears them?{2}
This place looks just like{3}it did three years ago...{3}after the storm...{2}
{17}{1}, watch out!{3}Don't get too close to{3}the river!{2}
Since food is stored in{3}this hut, it isn't scary at{3}all{24}not even in winter.{1}If only things had been{3}different three years{3}ago...{2}
Do you need to go{3}past here?{30}
You must be going to{3}Kraden's cottage...{2}
You mustn't go beyond{3}Kraden's cottage.{1}There are monsters{3}everywhere out there.{2}
Mt. Aleph looks{3}beautiful today.{3}It's so peaceful.{2}
Vale stays pristine{3}because of Mt. Aleph's{3}purity.{1}Taint that purity, and you{3}risk terrible{3}retribution.{2}
I'm jealous of you,{3}{17}{2}, because your{3}grandpa's the mayor.{1}Do you feel the same,{3}{17}{1}?{30}
Yeah... When travelers{3}come, you get to hear all{3}about the outside world.{2}
Hmph... I can't believe{3}you're not jealous,{3}{17}{1}.{1}I sure wish I could{3}hear the stories of{3}travelers.{2}
Vale must remain hidden.{3}Psynergy's secrets mustn't{3}fall into the wrong hands.{1}It's one of the laws{3}of our village,{5} handed{3}down from long ago.{2}
They seem to know{3}little of Sol Sanctum's{3}mysteries.{2}
The elders of Vale must{3}not permit anyone to{3}enter it, not even Kraden.{2}
Kraden...{5}{3}Can we use him?{2}
Hmm...{5} His knowledge is{3}no meager thing.{3}...We can use him.{2}
But he's more stubborn{3}than we expected...{2}
And cunning, too...{3}Cunning beyond measure.{2}
If he won't go willingly,{3}then we can always...{2}
You there!{3}What are you doing?{2}
What are we doing?{2}
Were you eavesdropping{3}on our conversation?{30}
Oh ho!{5} Well...{3}{5}I can't permit you{3}to continue your spying.{2}
Hmph!{5} I guess that I should{3}take you at your word...{2}
Hey, you're the ones who{3}were sneaking around!{2}
Sneaking...{5}{3}Who are you,{3}to accuse me!{2}
So Kraden's engagement{3}was with you...{2}
Yeah, we're off to{3}meet him right now.{2}
And this appointment is{3}important enough to{3}drive us away?{30}
Pfeh! If your errand{3}is more important than{3}our own, then...{2}
Nevertheless, Kraden sent{3}us away. He awaits you.{2}
Go...{2}
You're letting us go?{2}
Are you sure, Saturos?{2}
Menardi, we have no{3}reason to delay these{3}children any further.{2}
Let's...{5} Let's go, {17}{1}.{2}
Go, children. You mustn't{3}keep Kraden waiting.{2}
You'd better leave, before{3}we change our minds.{2}
Just who were they?{2}
They already know{3}too much about{5}{3}Sol Sanctum...{2}
...things that even{3}the elders of Vale{3}don't know.{2}
And what were they{3}saying about the{3}elements?{2}
The elements of Alchemy:{3}earth, {5}water, {5}fire, {5}{3}and wind...{1}They plan to set{3}them into motion?{2}
And the four Elemental{3}Stars are the key?{2}
These are things even I,{5}{3}a trained Alchemy sage,{3}do not know.{2}
Oh! {16}...{2}
You look like something's{3}bothering you.{2}
Me?{5} Ah, well...{2}
It's those two, isn't it?{3}Saturos and Menardi{3}were their names, right?{2}
Are they still out there?{3}They're very persistent...{2}
Did they want something{3}from you, Kraden?{2}
That seems to be the{3}case...{2}
Seems to be?{2}
Mt. Aleph and{3}Sol Sanctum...{1}They spoke as if{3}they'd seen them with{3}their own eyes...{2}
Isn't that strange?
Yes.{5} You can't enter{3}Mt. Aleph without{3}a very good reason.{2}
Why, I had to wait many{3}years before I was{3}allowed into the sanctum.{1}Of course it's{3}strange.{2}
And if they entered{3}secretly, then they might{3}be{5} thieves!{2}
We have to go tell the{3}high elders and the{3}villagers!{2}
Wait, everyone!{2}
I still don't know how{3}accurate the things{3}they said were...{2}
We can do nothing{3}until we confirm what{3}they told me.{2}
Then what should we do?{2}
Well, we go confirm it.{2}
...{5}Do you mean we{3}should go into Sol{3}Sanctum ourselves?{2}
Isn't that impossible?{2}
Why would it be?{2}
Just because{3}climbing Mt. Aleph{3}is forbidden?{30}
We're just going to{3}see whether they've{3}been to the mountain.{1}{5}Surely, that would{3}be acceptable!{2}
That's right. {5}We're just{3}going to see if they've{3}been to Mt. Aleph.{2}
We'll be fine if they{3}don't see us, right?{30}
Right. We won't be doing{3}anything bad up there.{2}
Sure, you say no, but{3}you know you want to!{2}
This will just be{3}our{5} secret, OK?{30}
No, {17}{1}!{5}{3}You can't even{3}tell your mother!{2}
Then it's decided!{2}
We'll make you the leader,{3}OK, {16}?{30}
There are some dangerous{3}places between Mt.{3}Aleph and Sol Sanctum,{1}but you can handle it,{3}right, {16}?{2}
You're more cautious than{3}{17}{2} is, {16},{3}so you'll be fine!{2}
You don't have to be so{3}blunt...{2}
There are some dangerous{3}places between Mt.{3}Aleph and Sol Sanctum,{1}so I'll take over if{3}you get nervous.{2}
If {17}{2} is our leader,{3}we'll be the ones who{3}are nervous.{1}Don't you agree, Kraden?{2}
You don't have{3}to be mean...{2}
This is our best bet.{2}
All right!{5} Let's go!{2}
You're not planning on{3}sneaking up to Mt. Aleph,{3}are you?{30}
Mt. Aleph is a sacred{3}peak. No one can climb{3}it without permission.{2}
Well, I'll overlook{3}it this time...{1}But I've got my eye{3}on you, {17}{1}.{2}
Mt. Aleph is a sacred{3}peak. It is forbidden{3}to climb it!{2}
Beyond here the path is{3}overrun by monsters,{3}so proceed with caution.{2}
This is the entrance to{3}Sol Sanctum. This is your{3}first time here, right?{30}
It's an important relic{3}of our past. Take{3}a good look at it.{2}
I doubt that... Few ever{3}get the chance to see{3}this sanctum firsthand.{2}
What's wrong, Kraden?{2}
Hmm...{1}Those two said there was{3}a hidden passage leading{3}deeper into the sanctum.{2}
I've come here many{3}times, and I've always{3}thought it looked...strange.{2}
I had always imagined{3}Sol Sanctum would look{3}different, somehow.{2}
What do you mean?{2}
Sol Sanctum was built{3}in honor of the sun.{1}There ought to be{3}something here to{3}reflect that.{2}
I was always puzzled{3}why there wasn't.{2}
If there is a hidden{3}passage, then maybe it{3}leads to...{2}
Well!{5} Let's see if we{3}can find it!{2}
I think he's serious!{3}Should we help him,{3}{17}{1}?{30}
But it's too dangerous{3}for us to split up.{3}We should stay together.{2}
You can't seriously want{3}to turn back after we've{3}come this far.{2}
Let's help Kraden.{3}We should stick together,{3}after all.{2}
This is it! We've found it!{2}
Clearly, this is the mark{3}of the sun...the heart{3}of Sol Sanctum.{2}
It's just as I'd imagined...{5}{3}which means those two{3}were telling the truth!{2}
But if what they said was{3}true, then that means they{3}must have been...{2}
They were thieves!{3}They came to rob the{3}sanctum!{2}
Let's hurry back to the{3}village and tell everybody!{2}
Kraden?{3}What's the matter?{2}
We're so close...{2}
Close? Close to what?{2}
We've come all the way to{3}the heart of Sol Sanctum.{1}To turn our backs on{3}it and leave...{2}
There's something wrong{3}with that?{2}
Sol Sanctum holds the{3}origins of Alchemy.{3}It would be a waste to...{2}
What do you think? Shall{3}we go a little farther?{30}
Thank you!{2}
Then you can all go{3}back to the village{3}without me.{2}
If you put it that way, we{3}don't have much choice.{2}
I'm with Kraden.{3}I want to look inside...{2}
Really?{5} We'll just go{3}a little bit further!{2}
Good! It's decided.{3}Let's move ahead!{2}
Wh{5}-What is this room?{2}
There's a moon in the{3}center... A picture of{3}Luna.{2}
This must symbolize{3}night...{2}
These rooms must be{3}connected somehow, don't{3}you think?{30}
Luna and Sol.{5}.{5}.{5}{3}These rooms must hide{3}some secret.{1}What could it be?{2}
But a room for Luna and{3}one for Sol? It can't{3}be mere coincidence.{2}
What does it all mean?{3}{17}{1}, would you look{3}farther up the passage?{30}
Let me know what{3}you find.{2}
Then just wait there.{2}
Just wait over there.{2}
That way leads out{3}of the sanctum. It{3}should be in these rooms.{2}
{9}{4}Wha{5}-What's...{3}What's happening?{2}
{17}{1} must have{3}found something!{2}
{17}{1}! Stop!!!{3}You're about to make{3}a big mistake!{2}
Wait, {17}{1}!{2}
What's wrong, Kraden?{2}
This is a most interesting{3}mechanism you've{3}found, {17}{1}.{2}
But{5} this is clearly...{3}some kind of trap.{2}
This is...a trap?{2}
Go look in the Luna room,{3}and you'll understand.{2}
You've done well. Finding{3}this means you're looking{3}in the right place.{2}
But if you just move one{3}statue, you'll be caught{3}in the sanctum's trap.{2}
But{5} why would anyone{3}put a trap here, anyway?{2}
I don't know who did it...{3}but they've hidden{3}something very important.{2}
Perhaps...{5}they've hidden{3}the key to Alchemy itself.{2}
Should I tell you more?{30}
Hmm... Honestly, I doubt{3}you could understand it{3}if I explained now.{2}
Hmph.{5} Well, even if I told{3}you now, you probably{3}wouldn't understand.{2}
We must try to find{3}a solution to this mystery.{2}
Sheesh... Another mystery?{2}
I'll keep checking the{3}Luna room. You continue{3}exploring the sanctum.{2}
My intuition tells me...{2}
that light must be the key{3}to this secret.{5}{3}...We should test it.{2}
{17}{1}{5}, let's see if{3}we can't figure this{3}out ourselves.{2}
{9}{4}Wha{5}-What's...{3}What's happening?{2}
{17}{1}{5} must have{3}found something!{2}
You found it, {17}{1}!{2}
Kraden!{2}
Excellent work, {17}{1}!{2}
Where did that{3}hole come from?{2}
When {17}{1} moved those{3}statues, two beams of{3}light shot out from them,{1}and then this hole{3}appeared in the floor.{2}
And {17}{1} dropped{3}the statue into it{3}after that.{2}
Hmm...{5} Good{3}work, everyone!{2}
So the statue puzzle{3}was the trap...{2}
and that other statue{3}was here to...{3}disarm the trap.{2}
And now that you've{3}disarmed it, we{3}should be all right.{2}
I'll observe from the Luna{3}room, where it's safe.{3}You handle the rest!{2}
You found it, {17}{1}.{2}
Keep doing that until{3}the light bathes all the{3}remaining quarters.{2}
Look, {17}{1}!{5} The picture of{3}Luna changed to Sol!{2}
But other than that,{3}nothing looks different...{2}
That's strange...{5}{3}They went to the trouble{3}of putting a trap here...{1}And this is all that{3}happens?{2}
Somewhere, something{3}else must have changed.{3}We must find it.{2}
Look!{5} The symbol on the{3}floor! It changed{3}from Sol to Luna!{2}
Surely...{5}there must be{3}something in this room.{2}
If we go this way, we'll{3}leave the sanctum.{2}
Ah ha! This has to be it.{2}
Let's go, {17}{1}!{2}
Wait for me, {17}{1}...{3}I'm on my way!{2}
It's a relief{3}of a minotaur.{1}The right eye is sparkling,{3}but there's a hole where{3}the left eye should be.{2}
{16} set the small{3}gem into the empty socket.{2}
You hear the sound of{3}shifting stone.{2}
It's the minotaur relief,{3}with both eyes sparkling{3}brightly.{2}
Wielders of Psynergy{3}are called Adepts.{1}Adepts are messengers{3}of good...{3}Never forget that.{2}
Our Psynergy was given{3}to us by the sacred{3}power of Mt. Aleph.{1}Psynergy is what grants{3}the wishes of the{3}chosen people.{2}
Psynergy is a power that{3}should only be used for{3}good... Never for evil!{2}
Something clicked!{2}
It looks like we've{3}found the hidden passage.{1}Things will be more{3}dangerous from here on,{3}so watch your step.{2}
More statues...{5} Hmm...{5}{3}It doesn't look like we{3}can reach them from here.{2}
Perhaps Psynergy{3}is the key...{1}{16}{5}, try to use{3}your Psynergy!{2}
Wha{5}-Where are we?{2}
Is that.{5}.{5}.{5}the ocean?{2}
No, it couldn't be...{3}The ocean has waves.{2}
The ocean...{3}What's that?{2}
The ocean is a thing{3}of endless water at{3}the end of the world.{2}
You would not{3}understand... Someday, I'll{3}show it to you myself.{2}
The Elemental Stars...{2}
They really exist...{3}The Elemental Stars exist!{2}
You taught us about{3}those... Elements are the{3}foundation of all matter.{2}
Stones, wood, even us...{3}All things are made{3}from those four elements.{1}Did I get it right, {17}{1}?{30}
Exactly...{2}
No, {16}...{3}{17}{2} is quite correct.{2}
As I have told you many{3}times, the elements are{3}the source of all matter.{2}
Earth, {5}water, {5}fire, {5}{3}and wind{5}{24}these are{3}the four elements.{2}
Legend holds that{3}the four Elemental{3}Stars contain{1}the purified essence{3}of each element.{2}
And now, those legendary{3}stones are before us!{2}
The Venus Star...{3}The elemental stone{3}of earth!{2}
Mercury Star, possessing{3}the power of water's{3}many forms!{2}
There is the Mars Star,{3}glowing red with the fire{3}contained within!{2}
And Jupiter Star, bound{3}with the wind's fury!!!{2}
Kraden...{5} Why are you{3}getting so excited?{2}
How can you be so{3}calm in the face of{3}such wonders!?{2}
You're looking at the very{3}source of all Alchemy!{2}
...Haven't I told you{3}all this before?{30}
What? I must have{3}fallen asleep, then,{1}because I don't have{3}a clue what he's{3}talking about!{2}
Then this must be a lot{3}for you to take in.{2}
The Wisdom Stone...{3}the Stone of{3}Sages.{2}
This stone dominates{3}everything...{1}It can transmute crude{3}matter into gold, even{3}thwart death itself!{2}
You understand now,{3}don't you?{30}
The study of Alchemy{3}began with the search{3}for this very stone.{2}
You still do not{3}understand?{1}Alchemy exists{5} because{3}of the Elemental Stars.{2}
I don't really get how it{3}works, but{5}{5} they have{3}enormous power,{5} right?{2}
Beyond enormous...{3}With a single gem, one{3}could conquer the world!{2}
Now, perhaps, you begin{3}to understand.{2}
Don't scare us like that,{3}Kraden.{5} I totally thought{3}you were serious.{1}Heh...{3}Conquering the world...{2}
Who can say what{3}the truth is?{2}
That's why I've been{3}searching for the{3}Elemental Stars.{1}I seek to learn{3}the truth about{3}these stones.{2}
Now they lie before me...{2}
{9}{4}Whoa...{7}{2}
Be careful, Kraden!{3}It looks slippery.{2}
But I must examine{3}the Elemental Stars...{2}
Make the boys do it!{2}
Oh, I couldn't ask{5}.{5}.{5}.{3}Would you mind?{2}
He'd be glad to get{3}the stones for you,{3}right, {16}?{30}
Don't make me ask you again!{5}{3}Won't you please do it?{30}
Thank you!{2}
You'll need this,{3}{16}.{2}
{18}{1} got the{3}Mythril Bags.{2}
You can't carry any more.{3}Organize your items.{2}
You brought those from{3}your cottage, right,{3}Kraden?{2}
What are those bags?{2}
They're made of woven{3}threads of Mythril.{2}
I prepared them for{3}just such an occasion.{2}
Now, go fetch the{3}Elemental Stars and put{3}them in those bags.{2}
There aren't any Elemental{3}Stars out there!{2}
{17}{1} put the{3}Venus Star in a{3}Mythril Bag.{2}
Good, good!{3}Now, go fetch the others!{2}
{18}{1} put the{3}Venus Star in a{3}Mythril Bag.{2}
{18}{1} put the{3}Mercury Star in a{3}Mythril Bag.{2}
{18}{1} put the{3}Jupiter Star in a{3}Mythril Bag.{2}
{18}{1} put the{3}Mars Star in a{3}Mythril Bag.{2}
Now, put the Elemental{3}Stars in those bags and{3}bring them here.{2}
Be careful, both of you.{2}
Good, good.{3}Now go fetch the others!{2}
Kraden, you're as{3}giddy as a schoolgirl.{2}
It looks like they've{3}spotted us.{2}
I thought we'd be{3}safe until they'd gotten{3}all the Elemental Stars.{2}
You! You mean to steal{3}the Elemental Stars!{2}
Master Kraden...{5} Are you{3}calling us thieves?{2}
As I recall, aren't{3}you the one who stole{3}our information?{2}
What will you do with{3}us once you've got{3}the Elemental Stars?{2}
I'm sure they'll do{3}us in once they no{3}longer need us!{2}
Relax...{3}You will not be hurt.{2}
That was our{5}{3}agreement, was it not?{2}
That all depends on how{3}well they cooperate.{2}
They'll be safe, as long{3}as they hand over{3}the Elemental Stars.{2}
Isn't that enough?{2}
You heard us...{3}If you wish to save{3}your friends,{1}then give us the{3}Elemental Stars!{2}
Do you accept our terms?{30}
No, {17}{1}! You{3}must not give them{3}the Elemental Stars!{2}
Very good, {17}{1}!{5}{3}You must not give them{3}the Elemental Stars!{2}
Why would you deny us?{3}Don't you want your{3}friends to be safe?{2}
What guarantee do we{3}have once we've given{3}you the Elemental Stars?{2}
Guarantee...{5}{3}Ah. I have one.{2}
You will have to remove{3}your mask.{2}
Th-{5}That means...{2}
Ah, of course. A fine{3}idea... He will be{3}our guarantee.{2}
Under the circumstances,{3}we have little choice.{1}{17}{5}! Remove your mask!{2}
What?{5} What did he say,{3}{17}{1}?{2}
He called that guy {17}{5}...{5}{3}That's what he said,{3}isn't it?{30}
You heard it too?{5}{3}{17}{5}?{5} It can't be...{2}
But that's what I{3}heard. {5}{17}{5}?{3}It can't be...{2}
That day...{5} The Boulder...{3}We saw him die,{3}didn't we?{30}
You remember it, too,{3}{17}{1}?{5}{1}Then...what kind of{3}guarantee are they{3}giving us?{2}
We searched for weeks,{3}but we still couldn't{3}find him.{2}
What's wrong, {17}{5}...{5}{3}Don't you want them{3}to feel safe?{2}
{17}{5}... Wasn't that the{3}name of your brother?{2}
But that accident...{5}{3}My brother, he...{2}
I'll do it.{2}
I'll{5}.{5}.{5}.take off my mask.{2}
{9}{4}I{5}-It's not possible...{7}{2}
Is he...{2}
I know I've caused you{3}much grief, {17}{6}.{2}
It was a miracle that{3}I survived that day...{2}
We are the ones{3}who saved him.{2}
We saw him floating{3}unconscious in the{3}river as we passed.{2}
I've been with them ever{3}since... I've experienced{3}a lot.{2}
But why?{2}
Why did you leave{3}me all alone...{2}
{17}{6}...{2}
My own brother...{3}I thought you were dead!{2}
Save this teary reunion{3}for later.{2}
That's right.{5}{3}The Elemental Stars{3}come first.{2}
Is this acceptable?{1}{17}{5} would never{3}allow us to harm you...{3}or his sister.{2}
{17}{5} will be our{3}guarantee. Now, give us{3}the Elemental Stars!{2}
We don't have any choice.{3}Should we give them{3}the Elemental Stars?{30}
I guess I should take{3}the Elemental Stars{3}to them.{2}
{17}{1} handed over{3}the Elemental Stars.{2}
If you don't hand{3}them over, they won't{3}let {17}{6} go!{2}
{17}{2} took the{3}Elemental Stars.{2}
All right, I'll take{3}them.{2}
They won't let {17}{6}{3}go if we don't{3}hand them over!{2}
Will you permit me to{3}relieve you of those{3}Elemental Stars?{2}
Oh, Alex...{3}You're late!{2}
Alex is another of{3}our companions. Hand{3}the stones to him.{2}
Oh, great. After we did{3}all that work...{2}
{17}{2} gave him{3}the Elemental Stars.{2}
I'm afraid I must{3}apologize in advance...{2}
For you will be bringing{3}us the remaining Elemental{3}Star, as well.{2}
Wait a second!{2}
You want us to grab the{3}other one for you, too?{2}
Oh,{5} did you not{3}understand me?{2}
You said you'd set {17}{6}{3}free once we gave you{3}the Elemental Stars.{1}You promised...{2}
No, my friend...{3}We want you to bring us{3}ALL the Elemental Stars!{2}
Stop grumbling and bring{3}us the last Star!{30}
You don't want anything{3}to happen to your{3}friends, do you?{30}
Thank you for your{3}cooperation.{2}
We'll be waiting for{3}the rest.{2}
I doubt that's how you{3}really feel. I'll ask you{3}once again.{1}You don't want anything{3}to happen to your{3}friends, do you?{30}
What are you doing?{3}Bring us the final gem!{2}
...{2}
My brother is alive...{3}but...why didn't he tell me{3}sooner?{2}
If you want to save them,{3}you'll bring us the{3}final Elemental Star.{2}
I am sorry, everyone...{3}I am responsible for{3}all of this.{2}
There is only one left.{3}You're almost done.{2}
What's the matter?{5}{3}What happened?{2}
No!{5}{5}{5} Not again!{2}
The water's gone!{2}
Without the energy of{3}the Elemental Stars, the{3}chamber is collapsing!{2}
Is this the "terrible{3}retribution" the villagers{3}spoke of?{1}No, this must be more{3}of Alchemy's power!{2}
Whew!{5} It's over...{5}{5}{3}But what was it?{2}
What is that?!?{2}
No!{2}
That rock...{5} It's floating...{5}{5}{3}Do you know what{3}it is, {17}{1}?{30}
Yeah, I know it's{3}a rock, stupid!{2}
Me neither. It looks{3}like someone is using{3}Psynergy to lift it...{2}
Could that be{5}.{5}.{5}.{3}the Wise One?!?{2}
Such power...{3}Incredible!{2}
!!!{2}
Wow...{2}
It must be the guardian{3}of the Elemental Stars!{2}
This doesn't look good...{5}{3}Maybe we should just{3}escape while we can.{2}
But we need the Mars{3}Star. We can't leave{3}it behind!{2}
I agree with {17}{5}.{3}We're no match for{3}the guardian.{2}
The Mars Star will have{3}to wait for another day.{2}
What about {17}{1} and{3}{17}{2}? You can't just{3}leave them here!{2}
Forget about them.{3}They won't make it{3}out alive.{2}
But, Saturos, there's still{3}a chance they might{3}survive.{2}
Anything is possible...{3}So what do you suggest{3}we do?{2}
We take this "{17}{6}" with{3}us... If they survive, they{3}will want her back.{1}And if they want her{3}back, they will bring us{3}the Star.{2}
Regardless, Kraden must{3}come with us.{5} He is{3}connected to all of this.{2}
Alex{5}... {3}Are you breaking{3}our promise?{2}
Conditions have changed{3}since we made that{3}promise.{2}
{17}{6}'s not any part of{3}this. I won't let you{3}hurt her!{2}
Do what you will with me.{3}Just let {17}{6} go!{2}
Your bravery speaks well{3}of you, old man, but you{3}cannot help {17}{6} now.{2}
If we leave {17}{6}, she{3}will surely die. Is that{3}what you want, {17}{5}?{2}
Perhaps we ought to{3}continue this elsewhere,{3}{17}{5}.{2}
{17}{5}...{2}
Please...can we go now?{2}
Let's make haste!{2}
Hey, don't push my sister!{2}
Who do you think you're{3}talking to?{5} You owe{3}us your life!{2}
Menardi!{2}
Master Kraden, you{3}will be joining us,{3}of course!{2}
{17}{1}{5}, {17}{2}!{5}{3}Don't{5}{5}{5} die!{2}
The Mars Star...{2}
It's a pity that we have{3}to leave it, but perhaps{3}we'll be seeing it soon...{2}
Well, this turned out{3}badly, wouldn't you say?{30}
It's a miracle we{3}survived.{2}
How can you be so calm{3}at a time like this?{2}
{17}{6} and Kraden are gone!{2}
You don't think they'll{3}hurt {17}{6} and{3}Kraden, do you?{30}
Thanks a lot...{3}But seriously, {17}{6} and{3}Kraden should be fine.{1}{17}{5} is with them...{2}
Yeah{5}, they'll be safe.{3}{17}{5} is there...{2}
This really is{3}terrible...{2}
We've got a long way{3}to go if we're gonna{3}make it out of here.{2}
We're{5} in big trouble...{30}
Let's get out of here...{2}
Quit acting so tough!{3}Let's get out of here!{2}
Hey, {17}{1}...{5}{3}{17}{1}, I'm over here.{5}{3}Come on, we've gotta go.{2}
Why are you standing{3}there?{2}
This place has{3}become dangerous...{2}
You're the dangerous one!{2}
The volcano will soon{3}erupt...{5} I cannot{3}hold it long.{2}
You must leave this place.{2}
The Elemental Djinn...{5}{3}They have returned...{2}
Take out{5} the{3}Elemental Star...{30}
{17}{1} cannot resist.{2}
Return it to its bag.{2}
The Elemental Stars are...{5}{5}{3}moving away from here...{2}
Without the power of{3}the Elemental Stars{3}to contain it,{1}the magma flows freely{3}once again, and this{3}chamber is collapsing.{2}
There will be no chamber{3}for the Elemental Stars{3}to return to...{2}
The world will be{3}exposed to the threat{3}of Alchemy.{2}
Alchemy? A threat?{2}
It can be a dangerous{3}power if it is{3}misused...{2}
If the Elemental Stars{3}ignite the flames of{3}the four lighthouses,{1}that power will{3}be released.{2}
As long as the four{3}lighthouses remain{3}unlit...{2}
The volcano...{3}It's erupting...{3}Flee, now!{2}
But how...{2}
Ah.{5} I see.{3}I will help you...{2}
Did that floating eye{5}{3}thing save us?{30}
Yeah, right!{3}Let's get out of here...{2}
{16} got four{3}Mythril Bags.{2}
You have too many{3}items. Will you drop{3}something?{2}
It is very dangerous{3}to go beyond here{3}when Mt. Aleph is active!{1}Leave immediately!{2}
I am all alone in this{3}dangerous place.{1}How can the Great{3}Healer treat me like{3}this...?{2}
{16} checked the{3}Psynergy Stone.{2}
It's {17}{2}'s chest{3}of valuables.{2}
It's a huge rock that{3}{16}'s strength{3}can't even budge.{2}
I thought Mt. Aleph{3}was{5} inactive...{2}
Oooh, my grandson!{3}Will {17}{2} be safe{3}in this eruption?!?{2}
Grandpa, we don't even{3}know if he's up there!{2}
But, Sis,{5} someone saw{3}him and his friends{3}climbing Mt. Aleph.{2}
They were hanging around{3}here while I was on{3}guard duty.{2}
{17}{1} and {17}{2} went to{3}Mr. Kraden's house.{2}
Didn't they{5} say they{3}were studying Alchemy?{2}
Yes, they did...{5}but...{5}{3}what does that have{3}to do with the eruption?{2}
Uh-oh.{5} It's Grandpa{3}and the others.{2}
What should we do,{3}{17}{1}? Should we go{3}back up?{30}
{17}{2}!{2}
{17}{1}!{2}
You're safe!{2}
Come over here,{3}both of you!{2}
Where have you been?{2}
What happened?{2}
Weren't {17}{6} and{3}Kraden with you?{30}
They were taken away?{3}By whom?{2}
What do you mean,{3}they were taken away?{2}
This is all very{3}complicated.{2}
We'll need you to tell{3}us exactly what happened{3}on the mountain.{2}
Come into the sanctum,{3}both of you.{2}
We had no idea...{3}The true sanctum...{2}
And {17}{6} and Kraden...{3}They're prisoners?{30}
They've been taken against{3}their will... How awful!{2}
Well...we can only hope{3}they're all right.{2}
Do you think they{3}can be saved?{30}
{17}{6}'s brother, {17}{5},{3}will protect them,{3}won't he?{2}
Then our hopes must{3}lie with {17}{5}.{3}{2}
What is it, Great Healer?{3}You have been very quiet.{2}
It's like you're a{3}thousand miles away.{2}
That hovering stone,{3}the one that appeared{3}before {17}{1}...{2}
What about it?{2}
I have seen it before{5}{3}in my dreams.{2}
In my mind's eye, it{3}appeared again just now{3}and spoke to me.{2}
You saw it just now?{2}
It must be the Wise One,{3}guardian of the Elemental{3}Stars.{2}
It told me what happened{3}to you in Sol Sanctum.{2}
So, what does the Wise{3}One say about the{3}eruption?{2}
Will the volcano{3}destroy Vale?{2}
It is impossible to stop{3}the eruption now.{2}
Will Vale be...{2}
Vale will be safe.{3}The Wise One will prevent{3}the lava from reaching us.{2}
What's the matter,{3}Great Healer?{2}
...The village will be{3}destroyed, won't it?{2}
Something even more{3}dreadful than Vale's{3}destruction looms ahead.{2}
What could be worse than{3}the destruction of Vale?{2}
A terrible power.{2}
The Elemental Star gems{3}house incredible{3}power.{2}
...And Vale has been{3}guarding those gems?{2}
The elemental lighthouses{3}will loose that power{3}upon the world.{2}
Once the power of the{3}gems has been released,{3}the whole world will...{2}
The Wise One wants{3}us to get the gems{3}back, doesn't he?{2}
This world is ours,{3}to save or to destroy.{1}Our inaction may{3}bring about its{3}destruction.{2}
What a pity...{2}
We cannot hope for{3}salvation. We must save{3}ourselves...{2}
Then what can we do?{2}
Acquiring the Elemental{3}Stars is{5} their fate alone.{2}
Are you suggesting{3}we place the fate{3}of the world...{1}in the hands of{3}{17}{1} and {17}{2}?{2}
{17}{2} is only a child.{3}You can't expect him to{3}bear such a burden...{2}
The Wise One has spoken.{2}
Each of you shares{3}responsibility for this.{2}
Now, each of you must{3}make your own decision!{2}
I don't know what to do.{3}{17}{1}, you decide.{2}
{17}{1}, will you accept{3}responsibility for the{3}fate of the land?{30}
I can't blame you...{3}I couldn't do it{3}if I were in your shoes.{2}
Are you sure?{30}
Would you like to think{3}it over?{30}
{17}{1}, will you take{3}the fate of the world{3}in your hands?{30}
I don't blame you...{3}I couldn't do it if{3}I were in your shoes.{2}
It is a terrible burden,{3}to be responsible for{3}the fate of the world.{2}
Mother would never{3}doubt your courage{3}just because you declined.{2}
Was it right to refuse{3}when the world is in{3}such jeopardy?{2}
It's clear that the Great{3}Healer really wants you{3}to say yes.{2}
Once you step outside the{3}village, you cannot take{3}back your decision.{1}Think about that before{3}you leave the Sanctum,{3}{17}{1}.{2}
And so the world began{3}drifting toward its{3}fated destruction...{2}
From the Great Healer{2}
To the File Screen{2}
Restart the game{2}
You accept? Oh, {17}{1}...{3}{5}You can't mean it...{2}
You chose to leave your{3}decision to {17}{1}.{1}There shall be no{3}further discussion.{2}
O, Wise One, these two{3}have accepted your quest.{1}Give us your next{3}command!{2}
You two are quite brave{3}to take on this quest.{2}
I shall be watching you.{3}Choose your destiny{3}wisely, young ones.{2}
That was the Wise One...{2}
What did the{3}Wise One say?{2}
{17}{5} must{5}{5} unlock{3}the power.{2}
Find the lighthouses...{1}You'll have the{3}guidance of the Elemental{3}Star...{2}
Um...{5} Then what?{2}
What should they{3}do there?{2}
Surely, that cannot be all{3}the advice you can offer{3}them, Great Healer...{2}
Seek the elementals...{3}The Djinn...{2}
They will prove useful.{2}
Isn't there anything else?{2}
That is all.{2}
That's it!?{3}Isn't there anything{3}else you can tell them?{2}
That is all, Mayor.{2}
I leave it up to you, {3}{17}{1}...{5}{17}{2}.{2}
H{5}-Hey, isn't it almost...{3}time to meditate?{2}
Oh{5} yeah!{3}Meditation!{3}Let's go!{2}
Well, what good are{3}those guys!?{1}Sending children off with{3}no help or direction...{2}
I agree, but...{2}
They didn't give us{3}any other choice.{2}
Then,{5}{5} when should{3}they go?{2}
It doesn't sound like{3}we can afford to wait.{2}
Tomorrow, then?{2}
Tomorrow?{5}{5} Yes.{2}
Hey, you're {17}{1},{3}right?{1}The tremors on Mt. Aleph{3}have settled down a bit.{3}Thank goodness.{2}
If you don't know where{3}to go, why don't you try{3}Vault?{1}If you head east a little{3}and then head south,{3}you should find it.{2}
If you follow the road{3}east and then head north,{3}you'll hit the Goma Range.{2}
The air is sparkling{3}because of the eruption{3}of Mt. Aleph.{1}Do you think the falling{3}powder is crushed{3}Psynergy Stones?{2}
You saw the Wise One?{3}The same Wise One from{3}the healers' tales?{30}
That is a blessing...{5}{3}A blessing, indeed.{2}
It was the Wise One who{3}saved the town when{3}Mt. Aleph erupted.{2}
Long ago, Lunpa, the{3}righteous thief, founded{3}a town in the north.{2}
{17}{1}, your mother,{3}Dora, has been crying{3}ever since you two left.{2}
If your Psynergy runs{3}low, touch a Psynergy{3}Stone to replenish it.{1}Unfortunately, the{3}eruption blasted all the{3}Stones helter-skelter.{2}
Aren't you worried about{3}crossing the land{3}with just the two of you?{30}
Aren't you worried about{3}crossing the land{3}with just three of you?{30}
Aren't you worried about{3}crossing the land{3}with just four of you?{30}
Don't wander too deep{3}into unknown lands.{1}It's not brave to fight{3}against hopeless odds.{2}
There is a difference{3}between being courageous{3}and being reckless.{1}True courage requires{3}caution.{5} Sometimes, it{3}may seem cowardly.{2}
Replenish your Psynergy{3}before entering a{3}dungeon.{1}Sharp warriors know{3}to do that.{2}
My control over Psynergy{3}has grown since{3}yesterday evening...{1}It must be because{3}I met the Wise One.{2}
The power of Mt. Aleph{3}stems from the Psynergy{3}Stones.{1}If the eruption cast{3}the Psynergy Stones{3}across the land...{1}then perhaps new Adepts{3}will...{2}
Do you feel any change{3}in your Psynergy?
Oh, I wish the Wise{3}One would come to me{3}and give me power.{2}
The Great Healer said{3}my Psynergy powers grew{3}when I met the Wise One.{2}
Vale has felt so empty{3}and quiet since you{3}two left.{2}
Sniff! I...{5} I'm not{3}sad at all...{3}Go. {5}Just go!{2}
This is my farewell gift.{2}
{17}{1} took{3}the Herb.{2}
You must save {17}{6}!{5}{3}You must, {17}{1}!{2}
Come back as a strong{3}warrior, {17}{1}.{1}By then, I'll surely be{3}a fine smith.{2}
I wanted {17}{6} to be{3}my daughter-in-law...{5}{1}Now she's gone.{3}This is terrible...{2}
Those visitors caused{3}the eruption and{3}kidnapped {17}{6}.{1}I knew there was{3}something strange about{3}them.{2}
That masked man...{3}He was {17}{5}, right?{30}
It's hard to believe,{3}but...what if {17}{6}{3}was involved in all this?{2}
What?{5} But didn't {17}{6}{3}see his face?{30}
If he is her brother,{3}maybe we shouldn't trust{3}{17}{6} too much.{2}
What? But that's not{3}what you told the elders.{2}
We're a small hotel, and{3}we get few guests...{1}But we still keep this{3}place clean, just in case!{2}
{17}{1}, please take care{3}of my grandson, {17}{2}.{2}
Receiving a quest directly{3}from the Wise One must{3}be quite an honor.{2}
I'm proud of you, {17}{2}.{3}My own son...on such{3}an important quest!{2}
As mothers{5}, Dora and I{3}will always worry about{3}you.{1}It doesn't matter how old{3}you get{24}you will always{3}be our babies.{2}
You guys are so lucky,{3}{17}{2}.{1}I wish I could{3}go with you.{2}
Please take care of my{3}brother{5}, {17}{1}.{2}
Who are you?{5}{5} You can't{3}be... You're not{3}{17}{1}, are you? {30}
{17}{1}...{3}That's a lie!{2}
He promised{5} not to{3}return until he fulfills{3}his mission.{1}My {17}{1} would{3}keep his promise.{5}{3}...Go away.{2}
I don't know who you are.{5}{3}I'm sorry{5}, but I don't{3}want to see anyone today.{2}
I heard that {17}{6}{27}{3}brother {17}{5} is alive...{1}But why is he caught up{3}with that bunch that{3}raided Sol Sanctum?{2}
Please return my precious{3}granddaughter, {17}{6},{3}to me. {5}I will be waiting.{2}
After {17}{6} was{3}taken, Grandmother{3}grew sick with despair...{2}
It's because Kraden was{3}studying Alchemy...{1}That's why the{3}mountain erupted, isn't it?{2}
They say the people who{3}caused this whole mess{3}had strange powers.{1}...{5}Is that true?{30}
If they were using{3}Psynergy...{1}That means there are{3}towns other than Vale{3}with Psynergy.{2}
If that's the case,{3}then I don't need to{3}worry.{1}It means Psynergy really{3}is a special power,{3}found only in Vale...{2}
I'm so jealous of you!{3}Being able to leave town...{3}Tch!{2}
Once you leave town, take{3}care not to use Psynergy{3}in front of others.{2}
I had no idea that such{3}a secret hid within{3}Sol Sanctum.{1}If only we'd known, we{3}could have stopped{3}this whole thing.{2}
Once I'm as old as you,{3}{17}{1}, I'm going to{3}climb that fence...{1}and journey to the lands{3}beyond!{2}
Sigh... No longer will I{3}see {17}{6} standing{3}there looking lonely.{2}
I don't blame {17}{5}.{1}If only we'd been{3}able to save him on{3}that fateful day.{2}
Look, {17}{1}.{5} That large{3}Psynergy Stone fell right{3}on top of the hut.{2}
It scares me that{3}something so big could{3}just fall out of the sky.{2}
I guess Kraden still{3}hasn't come back.{2}
Vale is saved thanks{3}to the Wise One!{2}
Ever since the tremors{3}started, Mt. Aleph has{3}been impossible to climb.{2}
The ground still shakes{3}sometimes, but everyone{3}says the danger is gone.{2}
The mayor was too kind{3}to those strangers...{1}None of this would have{3}happened if he'd kicked{3}those travelers out.{2}
The eruptions subsided,{3}but it may erupt again.{3}I'm still worried.{2}
Vault? Isn't that the{3}town with the{3}underground path?{2}
Once winter comes, the{3}lands beyond the Goma{3}Range get very cold.{1}I'm glad I don't have{3}to go there at this{3}time of year.{2}
If these sparkles truly{3}are all that remain of the{3}Psynergy Stones...{1}then Mt. Aleph must{3}indeed be in trouble.{1}I've heard the Psynergy{3}Stones are the source of{3}all of Mt. Aleph's power.{2}
I believed with all my{3}heart that the Wise One{3}really existed...{1}I'm so grateful that we{3}finally have some proof!{2}
Even the righteous thieves{3}seem to have changed{3}over the generations.{1}Nowadays, the thieves of{3}Lunpa are said to even{3}attack travelers.{2}
No matter how hard she{3}tries to hide her feelings,{1}{16}{27} mother{3}must be lonely...{2}
You'll be very lucky if{3}you find any Psynergy{3}Stones in your travels.{2}
I'm worried about you,{3}{16}. You guys{3}are like brothers to me.{1}Promise me you won't do{3}anything foolish. And{3}come back alive!{2}
I wouldn't worry if{3}my Psynergy ran low in{3}a dungeon, because{1}I know that I can{3}recover Psynergy by just{3}walking around.{2}
The power of my{3}Psynergy has dramatically{3}increased, but I don't{1}know why. I'd really{3}like to try this Psynergy{3}out on something.{2}
The Angaran continent will{3}certainly see trouble from{3}these Psynergy Stones...{1}It makes leaving Vale{3}all the more dangerous.{2}
My Psynergy...{5}hasn't{3}changed at all. It's{3}not fair.{2}
{16}, you're going{3}on a difficult journey, so{3}be sure to do your best.{2}
If you face any hardship{3}in your quest, do not{3}hesitate to come home.{2}
So if that was {17}{5}{3}who kidnapped {17}{6}...{1}Then why do you have{3}to go save her?{2}
I will think of {17}{6}{3}as I do my work...{1}We're all counting on{3}you, {16}!{2}
Now that {17}{6} is{3}gone, we need another{3}girl to replace her.{2}
Who could have known{3}that masked man was{3}{17}{5}!?{1}I guess he hid his face{3}from us because{3}he was ashamed.{2}
I wonder if {17}{5}{3}changed much. He was{3}such a good boy...{1}Do you suppose {17}{6}{3}could change like that?{2}
{17}{5} and his gang{3}must have left in a hurry.{1}I found his wallet when{3}I was cleaning the room...{2}
It's hard letting my{3}precious {17}{2} go...{1}But no! I have to be{3}strong for everyone!{2}
The Wise One chose {17}{2}{3}himself, and I am so{3}proud of my boy.{2}
Once {17}{2} leaves,{3}I won't be able to{3}rest until he returns.{1}It's a good thing we{3}have two children.{2}
I am concerned for{3}{17}{2}, but he is my{3}son, so I am sure he will{1}be all right. I can't wait{3}until he returns to{3}Vale as a strong man.{2}
Gee, I wish I could{3}see new lands, too.{2}
My brother's strength is{3}his best asset, so he'll{3}be a big help to you!{2}
{17}{5} inherited his{3}father's skill with{3}Psynergy.{1}Open your eyes, {17}{5},{3}and use that Psynergy{3}for good, not evil.{2}
{17}{6}, anytime you face{3}danger, just use your{3}Psynergy to overcome it.{1}The fire Psynergy you{3}inherited from your{3}mother will help you.{2}
Why would {17}{5}{3}take his sister,{3}{17}{6}, away?{2}
We almost lost the town{3}over something as silly{3}as the study of Alchemy.{2}
I'd like to believe that{3}only the people of Vale{3}can use Psynergy.{2}
If only I'd gone to Sol{3}Sanctum with {16}{3}and the others...{1}It should have been me{3}going on this quest.{2}
Vale's laws state that you{3}cannot use Psynergy in{3}front of outsiders.{1}But you know that, don't{3}you, {16}?{2}
I wish I were the one{3}who solved the mystery{3}of Sol Sanctum.{2}
Why is it that no one{3}else is curious about what{3}lies beyond this fence?{2}
I'm glad that {17}{5}{3}is alive. I was so worried{3}about {17}{6}.{2}
{17}{5} was a good{3}person. I still believe{3}in him.{2}
Even if your Psynergy{3}runs low, you'll be fine as{3}long as you can find{1}Psynergy Stones. They{3}immediately replenish your{3}Psynergy.{2}
Poor Kraden was taken{3}to some faraway place.{1}I liked that{3}old coot...{2}
Vale was saved because{3}people like this old{3}woman worked hard...{1}to protect those who{3}couldn't protect{3}themselves.{2}
I can't believe anyone{3}would climb the mountain{3}after such an eruption!{2}
I just don't feel safe,{3}knowing Mt. Aleph could{3}still erupt!{2}
The people of Vale will{3}never trust travelers{3}again.{1}Of course, I never{3}trusted them in the{3}first place.{2}
Why's everyone hanging{3}around the town gate?{2}
What,{5} didn't you hear?{2}
{17}{1} and {17}{2}{3}are leaving Vale on a{3}journey.{2}
I wish I could go!{2}
I heard it's going{3}to be really{3}dangerous!{2}
Oh, yeah? So everyone's{3}down there to say{3}good-bye?{2}
Hey, what's the matter?{2}
Weird.{3}{17}{1}'s mother isn't{3}there to see him off!{2}
You're right. She's not{3}there.{2}
Hey,{5} should we go{3}say good-bye, too?{2}
Sure! Let's go!{2}
We are counting on you,{5}{5}{3}{17}{1}.{5} Oh, and you, too,{3}{17}{2}.{2}
Don't drink the water{3}if it smells funny.{1}And...take this with{3}you, too.{2}
I know not to drink{3}stagnant water, Sis!{2}
Don't listen to him,{3}{17}{1}!{1}He's a pig!{3}He'll eat anything{3}that's not tied down!{2}
Hmm...{5} Dora is very{3}late...{2}
Oh!{5} That's right!{2}
Aunty Dora asked me{5}{3}to give this to you,{3}{17}{1}.{2}
I guess we're all set{3}to go, huh, {17}{1}?{2}
Think again, {17}{2}!{2}
It must be very difficult{3}for Dora...{2}
As {17}{2}'s mother,{3}I know how Dora must{3}be feeling.{2}
But I still have {17}{2}'s{3}father, while Dora has{3}only {17}{1}.{2}
She doesn't want you{3}to go, {17}{1},{1}but she knows you have{3}to, and it hurts to{3}see you leave.{2}
They can't keep standing{3}around here like this, or{3}they'll never leave.{2}
So,{5} one final farewell!{2}
{9}{2}Farewell!{7}{2}
We can't stay another{3}minute in a dangerous{3}place like this.{1}We return to{3}Kalay immediately!{2}
Master Hammet! This is{3}terrible! The bridge has{3}been destroyed...{1}We cannot continue{3}southward!{2}
What...? The bridge?{2}
This is awful...{3}How are we going to{3}get to Kalay now?{2}
...Master Hammet, I'm{3}worried about leaving{3}{17}{3} behind...{2}
As fond as I am of {17}{3},{5}{3}it is his fault my rod{3}was stolen...{2}
And his strange powers{3}will aid him in search{3}of the rod.{2}
{17}{3} has strange powers?{2}
We must leave this{3}treacherous place{3}immediately!{2}
But to where?{5}{5}{3}Where can we go?{2}
We have no choice.{3}We're heading north.{2}
We'll wind up in Lunpa{3}if we go north...{2}
Well, it's better than{3}being smashed by falling{3}rocks here, isn't it?{2}
Welcome to Vault,{3}the town at the{3}heart of Angara.{2}
Wasn't the eruption of{3}Mt. Aleph incredible?{30}
I was so stricken with{3}terror that I couldn't{3}sleep for days!{2}
Aren't you courageous!{3}Not even an erupting{3}volcano scares you!{2}
Master Hammet, a{3}wealthy landowner and{3}merchant from Kalay,{1}had his precious rod{3}stolen from him. He{3}was quite upset.{2}
I guess some folks got{3}robbed during the chaos{3}of the volcanic eruption.{2}
Master Hammet's servant{3}can't return to Kalay{3}until he recovers the rod.{2}
Those travelers left{3}in a big hurry.{1}They looked like they{3}were on the run. Did you{3}see them coming in?{30}
No, not Master Hammet...{3}It was a group of two{3}women and four men.{1}They were quite strange.{1}The young girl and the old{3}man didn't look too{3}happy to be there.{2}
Oh, maybe they left{3}earlier than I{3}thought.{2}
That poor guy, {17}{3}.{1}They left him at the{3}mayor's to look for the{3}stolen rod.{2}
Master Hammet's caravan{3}left town as soon as{3}the eruption stopped...{1}I guess that volcano{3}really shook him up!{2}
Nobody's stealing{3}anything on my watch!{1}We know the thieves must{3}be from out of town.{1}They must be!{3}No one living here{3}would break the law!{2}
Are you accusing us{3}of stealing Hammet's{3}treasured Shaman's Rod?{30}
Hey, just because we're{3}new in town doesn't mean{3}we're a bunch of thieves!{1}Besides, you can't{3}prove anything!{2}
Ha! Sure! I knew you{3}were too smart to listen{3}to rumors.{1}But it wasn't us. Heck,{3}we don't even know{3}what was stolen!{2}
Hmm, off on an adventure,{3}are you?{30}
It's impressive to see{3}youngsters like you going{3}on a dangerous journey.{2}
Oh, well. Stop in and see{3}our Sanctum while{3}you're here.{2}
Ruff! Rrruff!!{2}
I suppose these{5} children{3}can't go anywhere since{3}Mt. Aleph erupted?{2}
Mt. Aleph's eruption was{3}beyond description.{1}It was so frightening...{3}We're lucky we survived.{2}
Why does a wealthy man{3}like Hammet make such a{3}fuss over losing one rod?{1}He has more than enough{3}money. He could just buy{3}a replacement.{2}
No man should steal from{3}another during the{3}panic of an eruption.{1}It's unforgivable!{2}
Poor {17}{3}...{5} But the{3}rod may never turn up.{1}In that case, he can stay{3}here forever.{2}
That group of travelers{5}{3}was a strange bunch,{3}weren't they?{1}They seemed to be heading{3}to the northeastern parts{3}of the Goma Range...{2}
I bet it was those three{3}creeps at the inn{3}who stole the rod.{2}
I suppose it doesn't{3}matter how rich you{3}are...{1}if it can't save you from{3}an erupting volcano.{2}
Everyone knows those{3}three at the inn{3}stole the rod.{1}Tch! It's just so...{3}so frustrating!!!{2}
Hmph! It looks like{3}they're onto us.{1}We'd better leave town{3}as soon as possible.{2}
I was just about to leave{3}this town behind me when{3}the volcano erupted.{2}
Stealing in the midst of{3}a volcanic eruption...{1}Humans value money{3}more than they value{3}their own lives.{2}
This rock was blown{3}here all the way{3}from the volcano!{1}It looks odd, doesn't it?{3}It sparkles so much,{3}it looks like a gem.{2}
If only these rocks were{3}gems. We'd be wealthy!{2}
The other sparkling{3}rocks all crumbled{3}to bits...{1}But this one I found{3}on the roof is perfect.{3}I must be lucky!{2}
OK, mister...{3}Let me see that rock!{2}
My neighbor creeps me{3}out. He always has that{3}smug smirk on his face.{2}
Hey, mister!{3}Is it fun to see{3}strange new places?{30}
When I grow up, I wanna{3}be an adventurer and{3}sleep in a tent...{2}
Oh... If it's not fun,{3}then why bother?{2}
Hey... Maybe my neighbor{3}is the thief... Yeah...{2}
I wonder{5} what the{3}outside world is like...{2}
Is it just me, or am{3}I missing something?{2}
Ever since the eruption,{3}Grandpa keeps wondering{3}if anything was stolen.{1}He doesn't realize{3}we don't even have{3}anything worth stealing!{2}
Could they be thieves?{3}This is no good!{1}I don't know who I{3}can trust anymore!{2}
You never bought me{3}anything worth stealing!{2}
Could someone please{3}help {17}{3}?{2}
My husband, the mayor,{3}can't believe anyone from{3}Vault could be the thief.{1}But unless we find who{3}stole the rod, {17}{3} can't{3}return home to Kalay.{2}
I could help {17}{3} if{3}I were just a little{3}older.{2}
{17}{3} has great powers.{3}Wouldn't you like to{3}know what they are?{30}
No way! It's our{3}secret!{2}
Don't say it if you{3}don't mean it, 'cause {17}{3}{3}can tell in an instant.{2}
Yes. I... I do{3}possess strange powers.{2}
You have them, too,{3}don't you?{2}
What? My power{5}... It's{3}called Psynergy?{3}I had no idea!{2}
We have so much in{3}common... I feel I can{3}trust you with this.{2}
I am quite troubled{24}{3}Master Hammet's rod{3}was stolen.{2}
Would you please help{3}me get my master's{3}rod back?{30}
I see. I suppose it's a{3}lot to ask of a total{3}stranger...{2}
Would you really?{3}Would you help me find{3}the rod?{30}
I'm sorry. I shouldn't{3}impose on your kindness.{2}
Thank you. With your help,{3}I believe we can recover{3}the rod.{2}
Your names are...{2}
{17}{1} and {17}{2}.{3}I am {17}{3}. Pleased{3}to meet you.{2}
My ability to read{3}people's minds frightens{3}you, doesn't it?{2}
Am I really...{5}{3}Is my Mind Read so{3}frightening?{30}
{17}{3} and {17}{1}{3}clasped their hands{3}together.{2}
{9}{4}Ahh! My mind...{3}Stop reading my{3}mind, {17}{3}!!!{2}
So, {17}{1}...{3}Could you read {17}{2}'s{3}mind?{2}
Just as I thought.{2}
What? You read{3}my mind, too,{3}{17}{1}?{2}
I guessed that I could{3}help you read minds if{3}we shared our Psynergy.{2}
Hey, that's not fair!{3}Why do you get{3}to read my mind?{2}
You're right... It's not{3}fair to read one-way.{2}
{17}{3} and {17}{2}{3}clasped their hands{3}together.{2}
Whoa! I did it!{3}I read your mind,{3}{17}{1}!{2}
Let's use Mind Read{3}to find the thieves!{2}
Wait a second...{3}Won't people know that{3}we're using Mind Read?{2}
Oh, I see... You two can{3}tell when I am using{3}Psynergy?{2}
{17}{1}, both you and{3}{17}{2} are Adepts...{1}Maybe that's why you{3}can tell when I'm{3}reading your minds.{2}
Ordinary people can't{3}see anything. There's{3}nothing to worry about.{2}
Don't worry...{3}I will not read your{3}minds again.{2}
{17}{3} joined your{3}party!{2}
Let me read the minds{3}of the townspeople to{3}find the rod.{2}
Oh? You're going to{3}help {17}{3}?{2}
Thank you.{2}
Please look after {17}{3}.{2}
Really? You're going to{3}help {17}{3} in his{3}search for the rod?{1}I'm so relieved{3}to hear that.{2}
You're helping {17}{3}?{1}You don't look very{3}reliable, but at least{3}he won't be alone.{2}
Since you're helping{3}{17}{3}, I'll tell you a{3}secret...{1}{17}{3} has the power{3}to talk with animals!{3}...Isn't that neat?{2}
Hey! That tickles...{3}Being tickled by a{3}boy isn't so fun.{2}
Maybe they'll find our{3}stolen family heirloom{3}while they're looking.{1}I miss that old urn.{2}
These guys look reliable{5},{3}I guess. {17}{3}'s pretty{3}lucky!{2}
I wonder what sort of{3}thing an animal would say.{3}I wish I had that power!{2}
Master Hammet isn't the{3}only one who had{3}things stolen.{1}We lost a lot of{3}expensive goods.{2}
All our best weapons{3}were stolen...{1}I'm sorry I've only{3}got these cheap weapons{3}to sell right now.{2}
The thieves didn't hit our{3}house during the eruption,{3}but I'm still angry.{1}Once we find those{3}thieves, we're going{3}to make them pay.{2}
I wonder if they left us{3}alone because we don't{3}carry any valuable armor?{2}
Did you just arrive{3}in town today?{30}
Then I suppose you're{3}not the thieves.{2}
Hmm...{5} Something's fishy...{5}{3}You{5} thieves...{2}
Hahh... We're sure to see{3}a drop in business{3}after this eruption.{2}
We will help you anytime,{3}as long as you are{3}pure of heart.{2}
The healer must be{3}worried about...{1}Oh, never mind.{3}It's not your{3}problem.{2}
If you can ease your{3}anxieties like that,{3}then go right ahead...{2}
I wonder if we'll ever{3}see our stolen gold{3}statue again...{2}
The guests upstairs{3}weren't in their room{3}during the eruption.{1}We searched the room{3}afterwards, but we{3}couldn't find anything.{2}
Everyone thinks our{3}guests are the thieves,{1}but I think it's unfair{3}to accuse them without{3}any evidence.{1}Sure, they look suspicious,{3}but they've been quite{3}polite. And they paid cash!{2}
Those three strangers{3}sure have fooled the{3}innkeeper and his wife.{1}They're the type of people{3}who think they can{3}get away with anything.{2}
A fiery rock burnt a{3}hole through the roof.{1}Sheesh! It's always me{3}who has to take care{3}of these things!{2}
That kid {17}{3}...{3}He creeps me out...{1}He just came and{3}grabbed my arm...{1}I shook him off because{3}he made me uncomfortable.{2}
We haven't done{3}anything. You're a{3}terrible person if you{1}start accusing people{3}for no good reason.{2}
It would be awful if{3}our guests turned out{3}to be the thieves!{2}
That volcano cost us a{3}lot of business, and{3}now this robbery!{1}Those three are paying{3}us a lot of money.{1}I'll stick up for{3}them if there's{3}any trouble.{2}
The master and his wife{3}are blinded by money.{1}They'll be in trouble if{3}they don't help search{3}for the thieves.{2}
Fix the roof...?{1}Why pay for a carpenter{3}when I can just hammer{3}it a bit myself?{2}
What do you want?{2}
It looks like that{3}weird kid is with them!{2}
I can't stand him.{3}Don't let him near{3}me!{2}
They're acting{3}suspicious. Something's{3}not right...{2}
But you can't use Mind{3}Read if they keep running{3}away, can you?{30}
Isn't there any way I{3}can catch them?{2}
There should be a way{3}to read them, but how?{2}
Maybe the three of us{3}can surround one of them.{2}
Don't worry! This is{3}going to work!{2}
{17}{1}, you take{3}the lead.{2}
Hey, they're back!{2}
Uh-oh! They're comin' for{3}us one-on-one!{2}
Do whatever it takes...{3}Just keep away from{3}them, like before!{2}
There's nowhere to run!{2}
Uh-oh! I'm surrounded!{2}
Now, {17}{3}!{2}
A-All right!{2}
Wha-What is this?{3}What is he doing?!{2}
He shut his eyes...{3}What's he doin'?{2}
Are you done, {17}{3}?{2}
You creepy freaks...{3}You'll never come near{3}me again!{2}
Scram! Get outta here!{2}
Ow! Stop it!{2}
No! Leave me alone!{2}
What did you{3}learn, {17}{3}?{2}
It's them, all right.{3}I think they took a{3}lot of other things, too.{2}
It looks like they're{3}hiding it all somewhere{3}in this inn...{2}
But they won't let{3}me near them again.{2}
Then, I guess we have{3}no other choice{24}we have{3}to search the inn...{30}
It's a lot to cover,{3}but we're the only ones{3}who can do it, right?{30}
Please, {17}{1}...{3}I beg you...{30}
It cannot be done...?{2}
Don't worry, {17}{3}.{2}
He's just saying no{3}because he doesn't feel{3}confident...{2}
But when it really comes{3}down to it, he'll help.{3}It's just the way he is.{2}
I trust your sense of{3}duty!{2}
Well, if that's the case,{3}then let's go, {17}{3}.{2}
We don't have time for{3}that, {17}{1}!{2}
Leave it to us!{2}
{17}{1} always comes{3}through!{2}
I trust your{3}sense of duty!{2}
Well, it's decided.{3}Let's go, {17}{3}.{2}
He should be fixing the{3}roof now, but I can't find{3}him anywhere...{1}He's probably in back,{3}slacking off again.{2}
That sneak...{3}He's just wasting time{3}instead of fixing the roof!{2}
Wow! {17}{1}'s Psynergy{3}can move things, huh?{3}That's incredible...{2}
Uhnn... Uhnn...{2}
Ahh! Help me...{2}
{16} cut him free{3}from the ropes.{2}
I came into this loft{3}while I was fixing the{3}roof...{2}
But I found I couldn't{3}get all the way to{3}the back of the loft...{1}So I was looking into it{3}when{5} WHAM!{2}
Someone whacked me in{3}the head from behind!{1}When I came to, I was all{3}tied up.{2}
Strange... I don't{3}remember all these crates{3}being up here before!{2}
Maybe all that stolen{3}stuff is in these crates...{2}
Looks like we've been{3}found out!{2}
You're pretty persistent{3}for one of Hammet's{3}whelps, kid!{2}
Why are you working{3}so hard for Hammet?{3}What's it to you?{2}
Anyway, Hammet's already{3}been caught by a worse{3}bunch of thieves than us!{2}
I hear Hammet fled{3}to Lunpa after the{3}eruption.{2}
Did you say Lunpa!?{2}
A man with Master{3}Hammet's money shouldn't{3}go anywhere NEAR Lunpa!{2}
What kind of place{3}is Lunpa?{2}
The town was named after{3}its founder, Lunpa,{3}the noble thief...{2}
That family of thieves{3}remained noble even when{3}his son, Donpa, took over.{2}
But Donpa's son,{3}Dodonpa, is{3}an evil thief.{2}
The man has no morals.{3}I've heard he's truly{3}vicious.{2}
See, we're not so{3}bad. How about it?{3}Will you let us go?{30}
Seriously? If we return{3}all the stolen goods and{3}repent, you'll let us go?{2}
You must be joking!{3}We stole this stuff fair{3}and square!{2}
We'll just have to{3}keep you quiet!{2}
And there's only one{3}way to do that!{3}Get 'em!!!{2}
What? You mean, even{3}if we return everything{3}we stole and apologize,{1}it's still a crime?{2}
These kids are nothing{3}to worry about.{2}
{9}{4}Uhnn... Ohh...{2}
You'll stay here as{3}our hostages!{2}
Keep your mouth shut{3}if you want to help{3}him!{2}
They won't go away,{3}will they? They're back!{2}
We'll just have to{3}punish them again!{2}
We'll make you sorry{3}you were ever born!{3}Get em!!{2}
They...{5} They got us...{2}
Actually, for a second{3}there, I thought we{3}were goners...{2}
Wow! We won!{2}
I...{3}I'll get the mayor!{2}
After all the trouble{3}we went to, stealing{3}all this stuff...{2}
Haven't you heard?{3}Stealing from others is{3}wrong!{2}
Sheesh! I told you...{3}I told you we should{3}have skipped town...{2}
Evil never prevails!{2}
If you'll give me{3}Master Hammet's rod, I'll{3}head to Lunpa now.{2}
What will you two be{3}doing, {17}{1}?{2}
I suppose we have to{3}go after {17}{5} and{3}the others...{2}
He's reading our minds{3}again! Shouldn't we{3}stop him?{30}
It's too late, {17}{1}.{3}He's already done.{2}
If you say so, {17}{1}...{2}
I see...{3}So that's what happened...{2}
These are the thieves,{3}Mayor...{2}
What you did was horrid.{3}Stealing? In the middle of{3}a disaster!?!{2}
Hey, you're the ones who{3}left all your doors open!{1}You were practically{3}begging us to{24}OUCH!{2}
Sorry... I couldn't{3}help myself...{2}
What should we do{3}with them?{2}
We're going to lock{3}them up for a long,{3}long time.{2}
Hey, wake up!{2}
Let's go{24}get up! Get up!{2}
Hey, can you help me{3}tie them up?{2}
Hey, you! {17}{1}, right?{3}I won't forget this!{2}
Take them away!{2}
Thank you for catching{3}the thieves! You have{3}our sincerest gratitude.{2}
Really, you were{3}a big help!{2}
Let's take a look{3}at what they stole.{2}
Found the mayor's{3}precious urn.{2}
Mayor... Isn't that{3}your family's urn?{2}
My precious urn{3}has been returned.{2}
Found a gold statue.{2}
Hey, that belongs in the...{3}They stole from our{3}Sanctum? Those monsters!{2}
The town's treasures...{3}They're back at last.{2}
Mayor, we found another{3}chest over here, you see?{2}
{17}{3}, isn't this what{3}you were looking for?{2}
Now, you can return to{3}Master Hammet!{2}
That's right! I heard that{3}Master Hammet was seen{3}heading toward Lunpa!{2}
Oh no... Dodonpa{3}wouldn't miss an{3}opportunity like that...{2}
I'm certain that{3}your master has{3}been{5} kidnapped.{2}
How can I rescue{3}Master Hammet?{2}
No one can enter once{3}the gates are closed.{2}
What will happen{3}to Master Hammet?{2}
Calm down, {17}{3}. Master{3}Hammet is probably{3}still alive and unharmed.{2}
Dodonpa knows that he{3}can use Hammet to extort{3}a ransom from Kalay.{2}
We can't do much until{3}Dodonpa makes his move,{1}but at least we know{3}Hammet's safe...for now.{2}
Your name is {17}{1},{3}right?{2}
And you are...{2}
It's {17}{2}.{2}
Thank you both.{3}You have my deepest{3}gratitude.{2}
Well. Let's go then.{2}
Before you leave town,{3}please come see me.{3}I have something for you.{2}
What a mess...{3}We finally get the rod{3}back, and now this.{2}
I wish I could cheer{3}you up... You look{3}so depressed...{2}
I just want to rescue{3}Master Hammet...{3}That's all...{2}
But I couldn't ask you{3}two to help me.{2}
You have a very...{3}important mission,{3}right?{2}
That's right. I saw it{3}in your minds.{2}
I had no idea that{3}the volcano's eruption{3}held such a secret!{2}
Yes, we have to find{3}{17}{5} and his gang,{3}or we'll all be in trouble.{2}
Then, I suppose this{3}is good-bye, then.{30}
{17}{1} said he{3}would help you, {17}{3}...{2}
No, you've already done{3}so much for me. I couldn't{3}impose on you any further.{2}
{17}{3} got the{3}Shaman's Rod.{2}
I shall never forget{3}this town's hospitality...{3}I wish you all the best.{2}
Well, I guess we'd{3}better get moving, too.{2}
Are you leaving?{3}I'm still worried{3}about the rod,{1}so I'll just wait here{3}until you two return.{2}
Welcome back, you two!{3}Let's go find the rod!{2}
What? It's still a crime,{3}even if we return{3}everything...{1}AND we're really,{3}really sorry?{2}
Oh, wait, I don't want to{3}take your Djinni.{1}I'll just leave it{3}with {17}{1}.{3}Hurry back!{2}
Did you see something{3}strange over there?{3}I fought it, but it fled.{1}When I returned, I saw{3}it again... I wonder{3}if it likes this place.{2}
Hmmm...{3}It must be hiding{3}somewhere again...{2}
It just whacked me{3}in the head and{3}then ran away...{1}Next time I see it,{3}I'll be the one doing{3}the whacking.{2}
I knowits kind...{3}It'll be back,{3}sooner or later.{2}
You got it?{3}Wow, that's pretty{3}impressive!{1}Keep your eyes peeled{3}for others like it.{2}
So, you're hitting{3}the road again?{30}
Well, you'll always be{3}welcome here in Vault!{2}
Ha! You say that now,{3}but you'll leave anyway,{3}right?{2}
Smoke is still rising from{3}Mt. Aleph... I think{3}it might erupt again.{2}
Master Hammet, the{3}wealthy merchant... I hear{3}he never reached Kalay.{2}
It's great that you{3}caught those thieves!{2}
Are you talking about{3}Hammet's servant, {17}{3}?{3}He went out to Lunpa.{2}
I see, {17}{3}... I guess{3}it was impossible to{3}rescue Master Hammet.{2}
The eruption devastated{3}roads throughout Angara...{1}When the southern bridge{3}is repaired, you can{3}head toward Kalay...{2}
{17}{3} didn't go to{3}Lunpa all alone,{3}did he?{2}
Heh heh... I shouldn't have{3}worried about {17}{3}...{1}When did he join up{3}with you, {17}{1}?{2}
Everyone is very{3}grateful that you{3}captured the thieves!{2}
Those men you captured...{3}They're in jail now?{30}
It's been a long time{3}since we had to use{3}our prison.{2}
They're just upset, saying{3}all kinds of nasty things.{3}It's sad, really...{1}Maybe you should go{3}see them.{2}
Are you the ones who{3}captured the thieves?{30}
I just wish more young{3}people had your sense{3}of honor.{2}
So brave, and{3}yet so humble!{1}I wish all young people{3}would learn from your{3}humility.{2}
Ruff!{5} Rrruff!!{2}
You've made our town{3}peaceful at last...{1}I wish you could stay{3}here forever.{2}
Now Mt. Aleph has calmed{3}down a little, I'm going to{3}climb up into the crater!{2}
Of all the places...{3}Why would Master Hammet{3}go to a town like Lunpa?{1}I can't understand{3}how rich people think...{2}
How should we{3}punish our prisoners?{1}Public humiliation?{3}Or perhaps a beating!{2}
Nobody gets into Lunpa{3}except for thieves{3}and their victims.{1}You should just give{3}up on rescuing Hammet.{2}
With the road out, the{3}only way out is through{3}the cave in Goma Range.{2}
Where did {17}{3} go{3}all by himself?{3}I'm so worried...{2}
But when did they{3}join {17}{3}?{2}
You must be stronger{3}than you look to have{3}captured those thieves.{2}
I feel much better{3}now that those thieves{3}are behind bars!{2}
There is always a fight{3}when capturing thieves.{1}I don't really care{3}for danger like that...{2}
If you bring me a{3}bone, I'll tell you{3}something useful.{2}
Awwww!!{2}
Ruff ruff ruff!!!{2}
How did you know I{3}wanted one of these?{2}
I can sleep well,{3}now that the thieves{3}have been locked up.{1}I kept worrying that{3}they would take my gem.{2}
Thank goodness those{3}thieves were captured{3}before they stole our gem.{2}
Everybody's after my{3}rock! They want it{3}for themselves!{1}I can't let my guard{3}down for a second!{2}
What if that rock is{3}worthless? Maybe that's{3}why they didn't steal it.{2}
Did those thieves{3}come from Lunpa?{30}
The town's master is{3}Dodonpa, the grandson{3}of Lunpa himself!{1}He's an awful man, and{3}capturing his thieves{3}can only mean trouble.{2}
The Lunpans were noble{3}thieves under the rule{3}of Lunpa's son, Donpa.{1}It's all Dodonpa's fault{3}that they turned{3}bad!{2}
My father is so{3}worried about those{3}prisoners from Lunpa.{1}You'll protect us if{3}Dodonpa and his men{3}come to attack us, right?{2}
The reason Lunpa turned{3}bad is because Donpa{3}spoiled his son, Dodonpa.{2}
Father looks so sad,{3}worrying like that.{2}
The thieves hid the{3}stolen treasure in{3}the hotel's loft...{1}and they hid other stolen{3}goods in the cemetery.{2}
Just as I thought,{3}nothing was stolen{3}from our house.{2}
I guess nothing in our{3}house was valuable{3}enough to steal.{1}I have mixed feelings{3}about that...{2}
I wish I had something{3}worth stealing!{2}
You were such{3}a great help, {17}{1}.{2}
Allow us to show{3}you our gratitude,{3}like we promised.{2}
Received {20}{2}.{2}
Oh no, {17}{1} and{3}his friends have{3}too many items!{1}Please come back{3}when you organize{3}your things.{2}
Are you heading out{3}beyond Goma Range,{3}by any chance?{30}
Look for a cave in the{3}mountains of the Goma{3}Range, northeast of us.{1}Once you've passed it,{3}you'll reach Bilibin.{2}
Hmm... There's no other{3}way to get out of here{3}right now.{2}
You're the person{3}who got our urn back,{3}aren't you?{1}Thank you so much.{2}
I heard you defeated{3}those thieves!{30}
I suppose you really can't{3}judge people by their{3}looks...{2}
Really? My father said{3}you were the ones who{3}captured the thieves...{2}
{17}{3} learned a{3}lot by talking{3}with animals...{2}
The cave in the Goma{3}Range is a dangerous{3}place, but you'll be okay.{2}
I'm so relieved now that{3}we have our family urn{3}back, safe and sound.{2}
When I grow up,{3}I want to be just as{3}strong as you!{2}
...I wish I had{3}wings like a bird...{1}I want to be free...{3}to fly to the furthest{3}reaches of the sky.{2}
We found our stolen{3}weapons in the cemetery,{3}but they were all rusted.{1}We have to sharpen{3}them before we can{3}sell them to anyone.{2}
My weapons were found in{3}the cemetery. Hey, what's{3}that supposed to mean?{1}Is someone trying to{3}tell us our weapons{3}are too old?{2}
If you're gonna head into{3}the cave in Goma Range,{3}you should be prepared.{2}
It must be snowing up{3}in Imil, north of{3}the Goma Range.{2}
With the bridge out, it{3}will be quite a while 'til{3}we can go to Kalay again.{2}
Why are these people{3}so anxious to leave?{2}
It was the hand of fate{3}that returned the gold{3}statue to our Sanctum.{2}
When you stray from your{3}worldly path, fate will{3}guide you on your course.{2}
Go on...{3}if that eases the{3}anxiety in your mind...{2}
This child has awakened{3}to our teachings!{3}Guide him well.{2}
I'm shocked! Those guests{3}of ours turned out to be{3}thieves!?{2}
They hid all those stolen{3}goods in our loft?{1}Well, at least we nabbed{3}the thieves and the{3}town's peaceful again.{2}
I have a lot of leftover{3}bones from dinner.{3}Here, do you want some?{30}
Really?{3}Take as many{3}as you want.{2}
Well, I don't blame you.{3}A growing boy can't live{3}on bones alone.{2}
Thank you for the other{3}day. Are you leaving{3}town already?{1}I'll be praying for{3}your safety.{2}
Who could have{3}known they were{3}thieves?{1}Well, at least we got{3}some business. That's{3}not too bad, right?{2}
Of course, I always{3}suspected they were{3}up to no good.{2}
Gee...{3}I always get so hungry{3}when I'm cooking...{1}It wouldn't kill me{3}to taste just a little{3}bit, would it?{2}
Sniff... Ah... The smell{3}of cooking meat...{1}No one will notice if I{3}take a little bite!{2}
Wow, you have so many{3}things. Aren't you{3}a greedy lad!{2}
What? You want more{3}bones?{30}
Go ahead...{3}Take as many as{3}you want.{2}
I don't blame you.{1}Only a dog would be{3}happy eating nothing{3}but bones.{2}
If only we had escaped{3}to the cave northeast{3}of Goma Range.{2}
Blast! I knew we should{3}have skipped town sooner.{2}
Shut yer yaps!{2}
They got us this time,{3}but next time...{3}Oh, they'll pay for this!{2}
Sigh...{3}Will I ever{3}run free again?{2}
I wonder if this is{3}because we stole{3}Hammet's Shaman's Rod.{2}
I'll be out of this{3}jail before you know it.{3}You'll see!{2}
It's no use. Our Psynergy{3}isn't strong enough{3}to free that stump.{2}
You want to move{3}the stump, right?{2}
It looks like it's{3}trapped in the ivy.{2}
Isn't there anything{3}we can do?{2}
I know!{2}
I have a great idea.{3}Leave it to me!{2}
All right, {17}{3}!{2}
I did it!{2}
...Thanks for the help.{5}{3}But why are you here,{3}{17}{3}?{2}
I couldn't get{3}into Lunpa...{2}
Don't get me wrong!{5}{3}I didn't come here{3}to ask for your help.{2}
Your quest has been{3}on my mind ever{3}since I left Vault.{2}
Remember? I read{3}everything that{3}happened in your minds.{2}
I couldn't just leave,{3}not with all these{3}terrible things happening.{2}
If I can't rescue Master{3}Hammet, then I want{3}to help you...{2}
Please, allow me to{3}join your quest.{2}
Are you trying to get{3}to Bilibin through{3}this cave?{2}
Then let's go!{2}
Mother, look!!{3}A boulder blocking{3}the road!!{2}
You moved that boulder!{2}
We can go now, Mother,{3}can't we?{2}
How did you get{3}locked up in here?{2}
We came here to{3}escape the eruption{3}of Mt. Aleph.{2}
When we got here, that{3}boulder fell in a landslide,{1}and we couldn't go{3}any further.{2}
Then some strange men{3}blocked the other end{3}with a barricade.{2}
How did you move the{3}boulder without touching{3}it?{2}
I hope we don't get{3}trapped by another{3}boulder!{2}
Tell me the truth, now.{3}Did Alchemy caused that{3}eruption on Mt. Aleph?{2}
A careful search will{3}{5}reveal{5} a passage leading{3}underground nearby.{1}You might just find{3}some treasure inside!{2}
Bilibin lies{3}to the east.{2}
Far to the north, you'll{3}find Imil.{2}
It's a tree, but{3}it almost looks like...{3}a man?{2}
It looks like{3}a living person.{2}
Help me... Somebody...{2}
Welcome to Bilibin!{3}Please, just ignore that{3}strange tree out front!{1}Many brave warriors have{3}been sent to Kolima.{3}Travelers needn't worry!{2}
I hear a large group{3}crossed over Goma Range,{3}heading toward Imil.{2}
Did you see the tree{3}at the entrance?{30}
That tree was once a{3}man... He came to our{3}village under a curse.{1}His last words were that{3}he had offended the{3}sacred tree...{2}
I can't believe you missed{3}the tree... You should{3}look around some more.{2}
Lord McCoy has been{3}quite frightened{3}since the incident.{2}
Have you tried heading{3}southeast from here?{30}
That barricade was built{3}because there's been{3}trouble in Kolima.{2}
The road is blocked, so{3}you might as well{3}not even bother.{1}I heard they put a{3}massive barricade up...{2}
The road to Kolima{3}is blocked now, as per{3}Lord McCoy's orders.{2}
Ever since that man{3}turned into a tree,{3}everyone has been{1}too scared to go near{3}the town's entrance.{2}
Is it true that a{3}mountain exploded on{3}the other side of Goma?{1}The sky was a brilliant{3}red that day.{3}It was a beautiful sight.{2}
There's a tower at the{3}tip of Imil that people{3}say was built by the gods!{1}Everyone there calls{3}it the lighthouse.{2}
Something{5} changed{3}in the eruption.{1}Now, all sorts of strange{3}creatures lurk in every{3}forest and mountain!{2}
The lumber I ordered{3}from Kolima disappeared{3}after the{5} incident.{2}
Have you seen the{3}barricade we built on{3}the road to Kolima?{30}
It's pretty shabby,{3}because it was built{3}on short notice...{1}I had no idea it was{3}meant to block the{3}road to Kolima.{2}
It's off to the east,{3}if you want to see it.{1}It was a rush job, so{3}I had to take some{3}shortcuts.{2}
Are you telling me that{3}I'm responsible for this?{30}
Sure, I had them cut the{3}tree down so I could{3}build my palace!{1}But if anyone is a victim,{3}it's me! I've been waiting{3}for my palace for months!{2}
That curse of the tree{3}spirit is a foolish{3}old superstition!{1}I just want to live{3}in a big palace!{2}
You guys are so unlucky,{3}arriving in Bilibin at{3}such a scary time.{2}
You must be mad!{3}It's almost winter, and{3}you're going to Imil?{2}
We ended up like this{3}because of Lady McCoy's{3}foolishness.{1}If only she hadn't wanted{3}to live like a queen...{2}
Everyone gets worried{3}when town leaders get{3}scared.{1}I wonder if we can still{3}rely on Lord McCoy.{2}
Where did these{3}kids come from?{2}
No one would dare go{3}after what happened{3}last time.{2}
He begged for help as he{3}turned into a tree, but{3}no one would help him.{1}Is that how all{3}grown-ups are?{2}
I want to see{3}that pretty sky again...{2}
Only great Adepts{3}can enter the{3}Lighthouse of Imil.{2}
That explosion must have{3}been a sign of some{3}big disaster.{1}I'm scared!{2}
If things like this are{3}going to keep happening,{1}maybe we should stop{3}building that palace.{2}
I am glad I didn't{3}know Kolima was involved{3}in that incident...{1}If I had, I wouldn't{3}have done it,{3}no matter what.{2}
If all this trouble{3}was caused by the{3}sacred tree,{1}then all we have{3}to do is cut the{3}tree down!{2}
That tree at the entrance{3}is really a man cursed{3}by the sacred tree!{1}It's all because McCoy,{3}the lord of this town, cut{3}down all those trees.{2}
McCoy had the trees cut{3}down so he could build{3}his wife a grand palace.{2}
This is all Lord{3}McCoy's fault, but we{3}can't say anything...{1}He is our leader,{3}after all.{2}
Ah, Lady McCoy...{3}I would just{3}love to be her.{1}Will I ever live{3}in a lovely palace?{2}
The snow is already piling{3}up in Imil, and{3}the weather is freezing.{1}If I were you, I'd{3}wait until spring{3}to go there.{2}
We rarely see any snow{3}around Bilibin.{2}
When spring comes, I want{3}to go see that{3}angelic {17}{4} again.{2}
It must be difficult{3}to live in a snowy town.{1}I think I'll just{3}stay here.{2}
How are people doing{3}in Kolima?{3}I've been worried...{2}
I know that guy who{3}turned into the tree...{3}I remember his clothes.{2}
I can't imagine that{3}everyone in Kolima turned{3}into a tree, but...{2}
He seemed so happy, and{3}then he turned into{3}a tree!{1}What if that happened{3}to me?{2}
Long ago, the lighthouse{3}near Imil held the{3}Water of Hermes,{1}a magical liquid that{3}could heal all injuries.{2}
But even the legendary{3}Water of Hermes cannot{3}turn back time.{1}If only there were a{3}potion that could{3}restore youth.{2}
Could the Water of{3}Hermes save a man who{3}had turned into a tree?{2}
The Water of Hermes{3}vanished long ago.{1}After all, nothing lasts{3}forever.{2}
There was an able healer{3}in a village called Vale,{3}but he is gone now.{2}
The world will never see{3}such a great healer again.{2}
Have you ever heard{3}of the 'ocean'?{30}
If you travel over the{3}ocean to far, far away,{3}you'll find another world.{1}They say the world of{3}misty darkness begins{3}there.{2}
The ocean is immense...{3}You would want to sing if{3}you ever saw the ocean.{2}
I wish I could see another{3}world! If I were a{3}little younger...{2}
You must be used to{3}all types of danger,{3}being travelers and all.{1}Lord McCoy could use{3}someone like you.{2}
Only someone really{3}brave would go{3}somewhere so scary.{2}
A curse on Kolima?{3}What a scary development!{2}
You can't reach Kolima,{3}no matter how you try.{2}
I'm really worried{3}about Kolima. I was{3}born there, you know?{1}I can't even focus{3}on my cooking.{2}
Hey, Mister Head Chef!{3}Are you going to cook{3}or not?{1}Customers are waiting!{2}
Start cooking{3}already!{2}
Grrr...{2}
Did you hear a sound?{3}You heard it, right?{30}
I can't hear anything{3}over the growling{3}of my stomach!{1}I'm dizzy with hunger.{2}
{9}{4}Oooh...{7} It's been so long{3}since I ordered...{3}My stomach's rumbling.{1}Where's my dinner!?{2}
We came here because{3}Lord McCoy was building{3}his wife a palace.{1}I wonder if they stopped{3}because of the curse?{2}
I think that big tree{3}deep in the forest{3}looks suspicious!{2}
Do you believe a tree{3}spirit can curse a man?{30}
It's hard not to believe{3}after you've seen{3}that tree out front!{2}
Really? Then go see{3}Lord McCoy and listen{3}to his story!{2}
I can't wait to see{3}today's special!{3}Yippee!{2}
I went to Lord McCoy{3}looking for work...{1}I'm too scared to{3}accept the job{3}alone, though...{2}
I've heard songs that{3}tell of ancient trees{3}developing strange powers.{1}Maybe that power is{3}what caused{5} the {9}{4}curse{7}.{2}
I don't believe in curses{3}from ancient trees.{2}
Any travelers heading{3}east are stuck here until{3}the road opens up.{1}Until then, I'm gonna{3}make lots of money!{2}
Father, Mother...{3}I hope they're all right.{1}I wish I could go{3}home and see them{3}right away.{2}
Should I just forget{3}that I'm a newcomer{3}and just start cooking?{2}
I've had all the customer{3}complaints I want!{2}
Arghhh! That's it...{3}I just want to scream{3}with hunger!{1}But I still have to{3}smile... Boy, it's tough{3}being a businessman.{2}
I came to Bilibin hoping{3}to sell furniture.{3}Instead, all I get is...{1}a palace nobody's building{3}and a restaurant that{3}won't serve me my food.{2}
I see why they call that{3}big tree in Kolima{3}Forest the sacred tree.{2}
I don't care who does it.{3}Just undo that{3}curse, now!{2}
Yippee! Is it ready yet?{3}My mouth is watering{3}just thinking about it.{2}
I'm getting a little scared{3}hearing all these stories{3}from the villagers.{2}
It has been said that{3}a fairy named Tret{3}lives inside the holy tree.{2}
I am starting to feel{3}that this is only{3}a beginning.{2}
Please, give me strength{3}at times like these...{2}
Will I turn into a{3}tree someday, too?{3}How terrible...{2}
Someone will save us!{3}Just keep the faith!{2}
Lord McCoy is so upset{3}about this curse that{3}he can't even eat.{2}
The lord will only{3}meet with brave{3}and mighty warriors.{1}You don't seem the type.{3}Think you're up to it?{30}
Your honesty is good...{1}But I can't send such{3}inexperienced children{3}to see my lord.{2}
Hmmm, I see...{3}You seem pretty{3}confident...{2}
What do you say? They{3}look a little young to get{3}involved in this ugly mess.{2}
Nobody else seems up to{3}the challenge, though.{3}What do we have to lose?{2}
All right. I shall{3}let you pass.{3}Follow me!{2}
Lord McCoy is a very{3}difficult man. Be careful{3}how you act around him.{2}
Where were you?{2}
Lord McCoy is angry{3}because he couldn't find{3}you.{2}
The master can be{3}quite cranky.{3}Hurry along, now!{2}
No one believed they{3}would turn into trees,{3}and yet they all did!{2}
Is there no one who{3}can aid us now?{2}
Lord McCoy would never{3}hire anyone so puny{3}as these kids...{2}
You are the only ones{3}I can count on!{3}Please help us.{2}
Really?{3}I can't believe he{3}really asked you.{2}
Don't blame me if{3}you get turned into{3}a tree.{2}
I am beginning to feel{3}rather sorry for{3}you now.{2}
If you want to see{3}Lord McCoy, follow{3}the red carpet.{2}
Make sure you don't{3}offend Lord McCoy!{2}
Oh, are you willing{3}to go to Kolima Forest?{30}
I forget how many{3}people Lord McCoy has{3}hired to end the curse.{1}And yet{5} not a single{3}warrior has returned...{2}
You don't look too strong,{3}but that may be for{3}the best.{2}
I always believed that the{3}old tree in Kolima Forest{3}should be protected!{2}
This is Lady McCoy's{3}room, so don't{3}touch anything.{2}
How many times do I{3}have to tell them? Why{3}won't they leave me alone?{2}
They should never have{3}let such young children{3}into the palace!{1}I'll be the one to get{3}yelled at if they break{3}an urn or something!{2}
Sending these children{3}to Kolima Forest?{1}Do they want more{3}people to suffer the{3}curse?{2}
I shouldn't have said{3}anything when they were{3}planning the new palace.{1}I think I might have{3}caused them to cut{3}down the holy tree...{2}
Of all the nerve!{3}Coming into the{3}palace unescorted!?{2}
Milady was renowned far{3}and wide for her beauty!{1}That's why milord is so{3}anxious to please her,{3}regardless of cost.{2}
Oh, someday, I want to{3}sleep in a silk{3}nightgown like this.{2}
Will I ever find someone{3}to make my dreams come{3}true, like milady did?{2}
Oh, no! This nightgown{3}has a hole...{3}Milady will be furious!{2}
You can see Kolima pretty{3}well from here.{1}On sunny days, Lord{3}McCoy comes here to{3}admire the view.{2}
Hmm. It seems the curse{3}of the tree has not yet{3}come to Bilibin.{2}
Lord McCoy hasn't come{3}here for some time...{1}It's because of the{3}curse, no doubt.{2}
Kolima Forest used to be{3}so green. Once the holy{3}tree was cut down,{1}everything began to{3}turn brown.{3}Is Kolima Forest dying...?{2}
What do you think?{3}These are Bilibin's great{3}treasures.{1}Whoever ends the curse{3}can claim these as his{3}own.{2}
Pick any one of{3}the four treasures.{2}
Are we really{3}giving our treasure{3}to these wimps?{2}
You will get the rest{3}when you succeed.{2}
What good is treasure{3}if you get turned{3}into a tree?{2}
What's the matter, then?{2}
Sir!{5} Some new warriors{3}have just arrived{3}in the palace!{2}
New warriors, yeh say?{2}
We've sent many a man{3}intae Kolima Forest, but{3}not a one has returned.{2}
These{5} warriors...{3}Did yeh get a good{3}look at 'em?{2}
Come closer, laddy.{2}
Hey...{5} Are these the{3}ones yeh were talking{3}about?{2}
They're but children!{2}
And yeh expect me tae{3}believe yeh can save{3}Kolima?{30}
Bah! Yeh're too young.{3}Yeh cannae handle{3}the job.{2}
Yeh can leave now...{2}
What is it?{5} Yeh've had{3}a change of heart? Yeh{3}want tae help Kolima?{30}
Hmmm.{5} Well, I'll grant{3}yeh're a brave lot.{2}
Here. This key'll get{3}yeh past the barricades{3}tae the east...{2}
Even with the key, such{3}wee lads as yerselves'll{3}never reach Kolima.{2}
He's making fun of us!{3}Calling us children!{5}{1}That's just irritating,{3}don't you think, {17}{1}?{30}
Are you serious, {17}{1}?{3}It doesn't bother you?{30}
Well, don't let him{3}get to you.{1}We'll just have to prove{3}we can handle this job,{3}whatever it is!{2}
So, yeh've decided{3}to accept our little{3}job?{2}
Hey, {17}{3}! You...{3}You don't look too{3}enthusiastic.{2}
That curse can turn a{3}man into a tree!{5}{1}You think we{3}stand a chance?{2}
What?{5}{3}Yeah, of course we do!{2}
You know we do,{3}right, {17}{1}?{30}
Come on, {17}{1}!{3}You said you'd do it!{5}{3}We're still going, right?{30}
Well, if {17}{1}'s going,{3}I guess I'm in, too.{2}
At least we all agree{3}on something!{2}
What troubles you,{3}Milord?{5}{3}They seem willing enough...{2}
They call themselves{3}warriors...but they're{3}naught but wee children!{2}
Aye, these are desperate{3}times, but I cannae send{3}such wee lads tae their doom!{2}
Then what will happen{3}to Kolima Forest?{2}
We cannae give up hope{3}on our other champions!{2}
But... But what about us?{2}
We cannae send yeh{3}intae certain doom.{2}
What if we said{3}that we were going{3}east anyway?{2}
Yeh can go once things{3}have settled down.{2}
But that means...{3}you're not going to{3}let us go?{2}
Ach, it's fer yer{3}own good, lad.{2}
I dinnae want tae talk{3}about it anymore.{3}Captain?{2}
I'm sorry,{5}{3}but you should leave now.{2}
Your name was...{17}{1}?{3}I'm sorry you were{3}rejected.{2}
I never, ever, expected{3}anything like this to{3}happen to Bilibin.{2}
Will you promise me{3}you won't go to Kolima?{30}
That's good.{2}
You are persistent,{3}aren't you?{2}
That barricade...{5}{3}You{5} may not need a key.{2}
Oops...{5} I shouldn't have{3}said anything.{2}
Well, I'm going to go now.{2}
Sorry, lads, but Kolima's{3}future is best left to{3}more experienced men.{2}
Hey!{3}If you can't do the job,{3}you don't get the reward!{2}
I can't tell you{3}anything else.{1}So don't even ask!{2}
What a shame, huh?{3}I guess you need to{3}be a little older.{2}
There is nothing more{3}to talk about!{1}Tell them to go.{3}I don't care how{3}often they return!{2}
It's a tough thing,{3}being so young.{1}They dinnae ken{3}what it means to be{3}afraid.{2}
That barricade is pretty{3}shabby... It was{3}rushed, you see?{1}The hinges on the{3}barricade are quite noisy.{3}They might break easily.{2}
I didn't think they'd{3}let you go...{3}You're too young!{2}
McCoy's Hidden Warehouse{3}     Do Not Enter!{2}
Even frozen Imil must{3}feel warm with that{3}wonderful {17}{4} around!{2}
There is a tree that{3}looks like a person.{2}
They're...{5} so heavy...{2}
This area is off-limits to{3}all those without a permit.{3}     {24}Lord McCoy{2}
It's so quiet...{2}
What is the matter, {17}{3}?{2}
This tree...was a person.{2}
Everyone in Kolima has{3}been turned into a tree.{2}
It's horrible! All these{3}trees with clothes are{3}really Kolima's villagers!{2}
Why? Do you know{3}why this happened?{30}
I see...{5} It was{3}because they hurt{3}the holy tree?{2}
I see...{3}Who could have known?{2}
What is it now, {17}{3}?{2}
That sparkly stuff{3}on the ground...{3}What is it?{2}
{9}{4}Aaah!{5} What's happening!?{2}
{9}{4}My mind!!!{3}Someone{5} is attacking my{24}{2}
{9}{4}I...{5} I can't...{3}I can't even stand up!{2}
What is that?{5}{3}Something's falling from{3}the sky!{2}
It's sparkling!{5}{5}{3}Could this be{5} what turned{3}those people into...{2}
We've got to get{3}out of here!{2}
I can't!{5} I can't move!!{2}
Oh, no...{5}{3}If it touches us,{3}we'll turn into trees!{2}
{17}{1}... What just{3}happened to us?{1}That barrier...{3}Did it save us?{30}
I think so, too, {17}{1}.{1}I think I know what{3}those domes were...{2}
No, I think {17}{2}{3}is right.{1}I think I know what{3}those domes were...{2}
You know what{3}those fields were?{2}
It was our Psynergy.{2}
What are you, crazy?{2}
I didn't use{3}any Psynergy!{2}
Hey...{5}{5} I can stand...{5}{3}I can move again!{2}
You're right.{3}I can stand, too...{2}
{17}{3}, it's okay!{3}Go ahead!{5} Stand up!{2}
Those barriers...{2}
We thought that{5} Psynergy{3}was only used when we{3}concentrate, right?{30}
You're such a liar, {17}{1}!{2}
When I was training, I'd{3}focus so hard, I thought{3}my head would burst.{2}
Well, maybe it's just{3}easier for you, but{3}when I use Psynergy...{2}
But what? The only way{3}you can use Psynergy is{3}by concentrating!{2}
Anyway, I'm certain that{3}was Psynergy we{3}were projecting.{2}
That must mean that{3}some Psynergy acts only{3}when it's needed.{2}
You mean, like when{3}we're in danger?{2}
I think it's like{3}when we strike critical{3}hits in battle.{1}We can't control it,{3}but it's there when{3}we need it.{2}
I can agree with what{3}{17}{2} is saying. It is{3}definitely possible...{2}
Wouldn't it be something{3}if we could use this{3}power at any time, {17}{1}?{30}
Yeah! Let's start{3}trying to master{3}this power!{2}
You...{5}{5}{3}You're not really into{3}this, are you?{2}
Watch out!{3}It's happening again!{2}
Hroom!{5} Why?{5}{5} Why don't{3}they turn into trees...?{2}
Who are they?{2}
What people are these,{3}who are immune to{3}Tret's glamour?{2}
Have they come to save{3}that village with{3}their strange powers?{2}
It will not be enough{5}{3}to save the people{3}of Kolima.{2}
They have earned{3}their fate...{1}Kolima took their axes{3}to me, and now I shall{3}take mine to them!{2}
You children may not know{3}this...but we are{5} dying.{2}
And Kolima Forest will{3}wither and die when{3}we are gone.{2}
We are not the only ones{3}who will die, Laurel.{1}Once we are gone,{3}they, too, will go!{2}
Tret was once a kindly{3}forest king.{2}
But he is slowly dying,{3}and his heart has{3}torn in two...{2}
His wrathful side turned{3}the people of Kolima{3}into trees.{2}
The kind Tret{3}speaks no more.{2}
Hroom!{5} The kindly heart{3}invites destruction...{5}{5}{3}I need no kindness!{2}
If you wish to save{3}those whom Tret turned{3}into trees,{1}you must reawaken{3}his gentle side.{2}
But...{5}if you cannot{3}stop Tret from withering,{3}we all will...{2}
Look for Tret deep{3}within the forest.{2}
It's no use, Laurel.{5}{3}Humans cannot be trusted!{1}I shall die...{5}and the{3}rest of the forest{3}will die with me!{2}
{17}{1}...{5}{3}Isn't there anything{3}we can do?{30}
What can we do?{5}{3}Do you have any idea?{30}
It looks like {17}{1} has{3}something in mind.{2}
We'll leave it up to{3}you, {17}{1}.{3}Let's go save everyone.{2}
He's as stumped as we{3}are{5}, but he says he'll{3}help...{2}
I trust {17}{1}.{5}{3}He'll come up with{3}an idea.{2}
You're right, {17}{1}...{3}There isn't much we can{3}do now.{2}
So{5} the people of Kolima{3}will just remain trees{3}until they wither and die?{30}
I'm disappointed in you,{3}{17}{1}...{5} How can you{3}give up so easily?{2}
That's right...{3}We can't just leave{3}them to rot!{2}
But{5} how can we bring{3}back the nice Tret and{3}save the village?{2}
I guess I really don't{3}know what to do.{2}
{17}{3}, you can't give{3}up!{5} Please,{5} convince him{3}to help!{2}
Just promise me this{3}one thing...{2}
Promise{5} you will do{3}everything in your power{3}to save Kolima.{2}
That's a relief, {17}{1}.{5}{3}I thought you'd given up{3}on Kolima altogether.{2}
I was beginning to lose{3}faith in you, {17}{1}.{2}
But what can we do?{5}{3}How can we bring{3}back the good Tret{1}and save Kolima?{2}
I really don't have any{3}idea right now...{2}
I'm not sure...{3}What should we do?{2}
I don't know just yet...{3}But I'm sure we'll think{3}of something.{2}
Well,{5} let's get on{3}with it!{2}
It's you...{5} Soon, we will{3}all wither with Tret.{1}You will not be{3}safe in the forest.{3}You must leave now.{2}
Leave now...{3}before this forest{3}dies.{2}
The healing waters of{3}Mercury Lighthouse{3}might save Tret...{1}But the fountain's{3}waters have long since{3}dried up...{2}
.{5}.{5}.{5}{2}
Hroooom! He will not{3}speak to you, child!{2}
I control all in{3}Tret's realm!{2}
I control Tret's heart!{3}I shall not let you{3}do anything to him!{2}
Tret, the forest, and the{3}village of Kolima all{3}shall wither with me!{2}
Hm{5} HROOOM!!!{2}
You!{3}You hoped to find{3}my kindly self?{2}
Fools!{5}{1}You should never have{3}come here, and now,{3}you shall never leave!{2}
Your powers protected{3}you in the forest,{1}but now you are in the{3}heart of my power!{2}
Here, you will all become{3}trees, and you'll wither{3}with the rest of us!{2}
Oh...{5} Mmmmm...{2}
What has happened{3}to me?{2}
Was I...{5} I see...{5}{3}My heart was all{3}but lost in my rage.{2}
And you{5} defeated{3}the evil within me?{2}
I thank you.{5} I could not{3}leave this world with{3}so much evil in my heart.{2}
I am free now to leave{3}the world without regret.{5}{3}Good-bye, great warriors.{2}
Hey! Wait a minute!{3}We can't let Tret{3}die like this!{2}
That's right, {17}{1}.{3}We still need his help!!{2}
.{5}.{5}.{5}What?{2}
Why have you not left{3}me to my dying?{3}Do you need something?{30}
What are you doing,{3}{17}{1}! Now's not the{3}time to fool around!{2}
That's right, {17}{1}...{5}{1}We have to save{3}everyone in Kolima!{2}
I{5} turned the people{3}of Kolima into trees?{2}
Hroom! I must release{3}them before they die{3}with the forest!{2}
I can't do it...{5} My power{3}no longer reaches{3}Kolima...{2}
People of Kolima...{3}Forgive me...{2}
Tret's too weak! He{3}doesn't have the power to{3}save Kolima.{2}
No! We have{3}to heal him!{1}We can't let the{3}people of Kolima die{3}with the forest!{2}
Every life in Kolima{3}depends on us!{2}
We have to restore Tret{3}and save the people{3}of Kolima!{2}
Let's go, {17}{1}.{2}
Let's try the water!{2}
Surely that will{3}revive Tret!{2}
Hurry, {17}{1}.{2}
.{5}.{5}.{5}{2}
People of Kolima...{3}Forgive me...{2}
The Water of Hermes{3}seeped into Tret.{2}
I feel a great power{3}spreading through me...{2}
Hroooom...{5} Life flows{3}within me once again.{2}
Tret...{2}
As you have recovered,{3}so has our forest...{2}
I am sorry to have{3}worried you so, Laurel.{2}
And you, young ones...{3}Didn't you have a{3}favor to ask of me?{30}
Yes, Tret...{5} You must turn{3}the people of Kolima{3}into humans again.{2}
Yes, that's right...{3}I must hurry.{2}
{17}{1}! Did you forget?{3}We need to save{3}the people of Kolima!{2}
Tret should be able to do{3}it, now that his energy{3}has returned.{2}
Ask him to save{3}everyone he turned{3}into a tree!{2}
Please, Tret... You have{3}to save those whom{3}you turned into trees.{2}
That's right...{3}I must hurry.{2}
That should do it.{5}{3}The people of Kolima are{3}cursed no more.{2}
Tret did not always{3}possess this horrible{3}power.{2}
It only started when{3}those strange gemstones{3}fell from the sky.{2}
Gems from the sky...{3}Do you think he means{3}the Psynergy Stones?{30}
You really think{3}Psynergy Stones caused{3}all of this trouble?{2}
I know you don't want{3}to believe it, but{3}nothing else makes sense...{2}
I was indeed angry that{3}people had laid waste{3}to my forest...{1}They had even taken{3}their axes to me!{2}
Then those gems fell{3}into my branches...{2}
Then all of a sudden...{3}my fury overwhelmed me,{3}and I was lost in anger!{2}
The gem reached me{3}when I was filled{3}with sorrow...{2}
Our actions spoke our{3}hearts' desires, but we{3}had no idea...{2}
Those gems twisted my{3}anger into a force{3}beyond my control.{2}
Have any of the saplings{3}been transformed by those{3}stones, Tret?{2}
No... Only the elder trees{3}were affected by the{3}falling Psynergy Stones.{2}
There are others that{3}this happened to?{2}
So the same thing could{3}be happening elsewhere!{2}
You must have fought{3}many monsters on your{3}way here.{2}
Those monsters...{3}Maybe they were just{3}animals that were...{2}
Once, they were pure{3}of heart... Hroom...{1}Those gems have brought{3}a great evil to{3}the world...{2}
Oh! Laurel, you were{3}given powers, too?{2}
Different from my own,{3}but stemming from{3}the same source.{2}
Laurel! What in the world{3}are you doing?{2}
Wait. You will soon see.{2}
What did you see, Laurel?{2}
It's true{24}even the{3}animals have become{3}monsters.{1}And beyond the river...{2}
The river that{3}feeds our forest?{2}
Yes... An evil forest{3}has risen up to the{3}south of the river.{2}
Will you be heading{3}south across the river?{30}
That area will only{3}grow more dangerous as{3}time passes...{1}If you must go, you'd{3}better hurry.{2}
That's good... It would{3}be foolish to risk{3}your lives further.{2}
I owe you a great debt.{3}You have saved Kolima,{3}the forest, and me.{2}
May your roots dig{3}deep and your branches{3}reach high.{2}
Were you surprised,{3}{17}{1}? We trees have{3}grown quite powerful.{2}
Now that I have such{3}power, no axe shall ever{3}touch me again.{1}You may depart{3}with no worries.{2}
The forest of Kolima{3}is alive once again,{3}thanks to you...{1}We shall protect the{3}forest from now on.{2}
I know that I cannot stop{3}you, but please be{3}careful beyond the river.{2}
It must be horrible{3}beyond the river...{1}I am so worried about{3}you and your friends,{3}{17}{1}.{2}
Who are you...?{2}
Oh!{5} You are the ones who{3}resisted Tret's glamour?{2}
I sense a great warmth{3}within you...{2}
If you came to rescue{3}Tret, you are already{3}too late. {2}
Soon, Tret will die,{3}and we shall wither{3}away without him.{1}Leave now, before this{3}forest is destroyed...{2}
Leave now, before this{3}forest is destroyed...{2}
"Do not touch{3}Floodgate Switch!"{2}
The sign reads: "You{3}can't read this sign{3}from the back!"{2}
{16} flipped{3}the switch.{2}
{9}{4}Brrrrr...{3}Ah-choo!!!{5} I'm freezing!{1}Is {17}{4} here yet?{2}
Hi! Are you new in Imil?{30}
I should warn you,{3}there's a bad cold going{3}around right now.{1}Try not to catch it.{2}
You don't look familiar.{3}Are you sure you're{3}not...fibbing?{2}
One,{5} two,{5} three{5}, four! {2}
I tend to stay indoors{3}a lot when the weather{3}turns cold.{1}It's not good for your{3}health, though, so I{3}try to work out.{2}
{9}{4}{17}{4} should be here{3}by now! Where is she?{2}
We've had a lot of{3}strangers lately.{1}I wonder if they're going{3}to Mercury Lighthouse,{3}too...{2}
People get sick because{3}they stay indoors all day,{3}hiding from the cold.{1}You have to keep in{3}shape if you don't want{3}to get sick!{2}
There's been an{3}epidemic going{3}around Imil.{1}You should leave right{3}away if you don't want{3}to catch it.{2}
{17}{4} is running around{3}town, caring for the sick.{1}I just don't want to{3}be any more trouble{3}to her.{2}
{9}{4}Oooh...{5} Help me...{2}
Grandpa!{5} Grandpa!{3}Hold on!{2}
Oh, no!{5} This is terrible!{2}
Get {17}{4}...{5}{3}Please, get {17}{4}!{2}
{9}{4}It hurts...{2}
Get {17}{4}... Hurry!{2}
{9}{4}Oooh...{5}{5} I don't feel so{3}good{5}... Am I going to die?{2}
He's always exaggerating{3}things, but I don't think{3}he's exaggerating now.{2}
{9}{4}Cough...{5}{7}{3}The epidemic has hit{3}almost everyone in Imil.{1}I'm sick, too. {9}{4}Cough!{7}{1}What would happen to us{3}if we didn't have {17}{4}?{3}{9}{4}Cough{7}!{2}
Her palms shine with{3}a blue light...{3}Could she be{5} an angel?{2}
Our store is closed{3}until we get well...{2}
Do you want weapons?{30}
I can't sell weapons{3}until I am cured. {9}{4}Ohh...{5}{7}{3}I'm getting chills... {9}{4}Cough!{7}{2}
It's the travelers from{3}down south who brought{3}disease to our village...{1}{7}Are you from down south,{3}too? If you have no{3}business here,{1}then begone... {9}{4}Cough!{7}{2}
Who are these people?{3}They must be strong folk{3}to come to Imil in winter.{2}
Sorry, but I'm too sick{3}to do business today.{3}Try again tomorrow...{2}
We're closed!!!{3}Sorry... I get a little{3}cranky when I'm sick. {1}I'll open up the shop{3}when I get better.{2}
Why do they always{3}come when I'm sick?{2}
Mom's sick, but I can{3}get you whatever you{3}need...{2}
My dad is a lumberjack.{3}He's down south working{3}in Kolima.{2}
If you want to buy{3}anything, please talk to{3}my daughter.{2}
I wonder if they are{3}headed to Mercury{3}Lighthouse, too.{1}They'll never make{3}it without {17}{4}.{2}
If only we had some of{3}that mythical springwater.{3}That'd fix us right up!{2}
Why have two groups of{3}travelers come through{3}such heavy snows to Imil?{1}The first group has{3}already gone off{3}somewhere.{2}
We're the only inn that{3}stays open in winter,{3}since guests are so few.{1}We'll wait on you hand{3}and foot, so please{3}stay a while!{2}
Do you want to see{3}the restaurant menu?{30}
Here you go.{5} We're a{3}small town, mind you, so{3}the selection isn't great.{2}
Tonight's dinner is stew{3}and rye bread. Sounds{3}like quite a feast,{5} huh?{2}
So many customers!{3}It just goes to show you,{1}good things happen{3}if you work hard!{2}
Winters are tough here,{3}so I'm glad to have{3}guests to talk to.{1}I'm going to give{3}them the best service{3}I can!{2}
We don't get to eat{3}many fancy meals in{3}the winter.{1}A tasty stew would{3}be a real treat!{2}
I may only be a student,{3}but I can act as your{3}healer.{2}
Are you looking for {17}{4}?{30}
{17}{4} just left.{1}An epidemic is sweeping{3}the village, so {17}{4} is{3}very busy.{2}
{17}{4} is a very kind{3}healer.{1}I am just her apprentice.{3}I'm learning the arts{3}of healing from her.{2}
Have you visited the{3}old couple who live near{3}the entrance of town?{30}
Oh. {5} That's too bad.{3}That's where {17}{4}{3}was headed.{1}You probably just missed{3}her if you didn't see her{3}along the way.{2}
{17}{4} went to their house.{3}You might have seen her{3}if you stopped there...{2}
These folk are okay!{3}They don't seem like{3}bad people.{2}
{17}{4} was saying she has{3}a bad feeling about{3}something.{1}Could she have meant{3}these people?{2}
How are you feeling?{2}
{9}{4} Cough...{5} Cough...{2}
He's been coughing for{3}quite a while,{3}now...{2}
You'll feel better soon.{2}
{9}{4}Cough{5} cough...{5}{5}{3}Cough{5}{5}... {5}{5}{3}Cough... {5}{5}{5}Cough...{2}
How do you feel now?{2}
Much{5} better...{2}
No, Grandpa.{5} You mustn't{3}push yourself too hard!{2}
Thank you, {17}{4}...{1}I can't imagine how{3}this village would ever{3}manage without you...{1}{9}{4}Cough{7}...{2}
Don't mention it...{3}You should rest{3}in bed, too, ma'am.{2}
Who are you?{2}
Can I help you?{2}
Was that{5}{5}{5} the lighthouse?{2}
It can't be...{2}
Only I can...{2}
Oh, no...{5} Alex!!!{2}
I feel much better,{3}thanks to {17}{4}.{3}I should be fine now.{2}
What happened in the{3}lighthouse to the{3}northeast?{2}
{17}{4} is a good girl.{3}I wish I had a{3}daughter like her.{1}It's a shame her last{3}apprentice, Alex,{3}disappeared...{1}leaving her all alone.{2}
{17}{4}'s clan once lived{3}here and guarded the{3}lighthouse to the east.{1}Now, she's all alone.{2}
Even if {17}{4} heals us, this{3}epidemic will just come{3}back next year. {9}{4}Brr...{2}
I can't understand why{3}any one would exercise{3}in this cold weather.{2}
I am the healer while{3}{17}{4} is out, so tell me{3}if you need anything.{2}
I feel like a grown-up{3}when I am serving as{3}a healer. It feels great.{2}
Everyone counts on {17}{4}.{3}That's why she is always{3}so busy.{2}
We have to do whatever{3}we can to help {17}{4}.{3}She's way too busy.{2}
Fountain of Healing{1}Water of Hermes:{3}It brings rejuvenation{3}to all that lives.{2}
Somebody...is here.{2}
Someone is here...{2}
Can you hear it, too?{30}
Alex is the only one{3}other than I who can{3}enter Mercury Lighthouse.{2}
You can't hear it? Well,{3}I can. {1}Alex is the only one{3}other than I who can{3}enter Mercury Lighthouse.{2}
But this statue is{3}blocking my way...{2}
This statue is blocking{3}the entrance.{2}
Someone doesn't want{3}me to get inside.{2}
Did you do that?{30}
No, I saw it!{3}I'm certain that flow of{3}force came from you.{2}
I knew it...{3}I saw a ghostly{3}force pushing it!{2}
You{5}...{5} You could{3}see our Psynergy?{2}
Psynergy... Is that what{3}you call that power?{2}
We had thought you were{3}using Psynergy when you{3}healed that old man, {17}{4}.{2}
That's a special power,{3}handed down to members{3}of the Mercury Clan{1}from generation{3}to generation.{2}
It is called Ply,{3}a power generated{3}through meditation.{2}
It was once{3}much stronger...{2}
This Mercury Clan{3}sounds a little like people{3}of Vale, don't you think?{30}
Sure... They're the sworn{3}protectors of a special{3}power, just like us!{2}
Oh, come on! Both of{3}them are protectors of{3}special powers!{1}It's just the names{3}that are different!{2}
I have to go...{3}I have to find whoever{3}entered the lighthouse.{2}
{17}{4} used Ply.{2}
A monster inside{3}Mercury Lighthouse?{3}How could this be!?{2}
I have to get{3}past him!{2}
The path is blocked again.{5}{3}What am I going to do?{2}
This statue wasn't{3}here before. I wonder{3}if Alex...{1}No, Alex wouldn't do{3}that...but what if he's{3}not alone?{2}
You've saved me again,{3}haven't you!{2}
Do you have business{3}in the lighthouse, too?{30}
Please tell me{3}the truth!{2}
I can't believe you'd{3}go so far to help{3}someone you just met.{2}
You have some errand{3}in this lighthouse,{3}don't you?{30}
Please tell me{3}the truth!{30}
I thought so...{2}
I am sure there will{3}be more places ahead that{3}I cannot pass alone.{2}
Only those of the Mercury{3}Clan are permitted to{3}enter this place.{2}
However, I sense{3}something special about{3}you.{1}I feel that I{3}can trust you!{2}
The Adept {17}{4} joined{3}your party!{2}
It's too late! The{3}lighthouse has already{3}been lit!{2}
It...{5} It can't be!{2}
The beacon cannot be{3}lit without the{3}Mercury Star...{2}
...The Elemental Stars{3}were stolen from Sol{3}Sanctum, on Mt. Aleph.{2}
Mt. Aleph... Sol Sanctum...{5}{3}Are you healers from{3}Sol Sanctum?{30}
We came from a village{3}called Vale to recover{3}the three Elemental Stars.{2}
But, unlike you, we are{3}not healers.{2}
We came from Mt. Aleph,{3}but we're not healers.{2}
We came from a village{3}called Vale to recover{3}the three Elemental Stars.{2}
Did you say{5} Vale?{2}
Our village was there to{3}protect Sol Sanctum, but{3}the Stars were stolen.{2}
That sounds just like{3}my clan...{2}
I have failed in the{3}one duty placed upon me...{5}{1}This is terrible.{2}
{17}{1}! {17}{2}!{2}
So it's you, {17}{1}!{2}
Heh heh! Those kids are{3}still alive?{2}
You came all this way to{3}save {17}{6} and Kraden?{2}
That's not all...{3}We're after the{3}Elemental Stars!{2}
In other words,{5} they've{3}come to stop us.{2}
Then we have no choice...{1}Let's take care of{3}them now, before they{3}can do any harm!{2}
Menardi... {5}Wait!{2}
Oh, Saturos...{3}They want to...{2}
I heard everything.{2}
They were lucky to{3}survive the eruption of{3}Mt. Aleph.{2}
You have endured so{3}much, and now you want{3}to throw your lives away?{2}
Fine. If that is your{3}wish, prepare to have{3}it granted.{2}
Saturos... Are you going{3}to fight them alone?{2}
Menardi, I can't expect{3}you to leave our hostages{3}alone and help me, can I?{2}
Umm...{5} That's true...{2}
Besides, I want to{3}see how much their{3}powers have developed.{2}
Are you sure about this,{3}Saturos?{2}
Leave me be!{5} Head for the{3}next lighthouse{24}now!{2}
Come here, child...{2}
Do you mean to{3}defy me?{2}
I should teach you a{3}lesson, child, but...{2}
{17}{5}, I'd get your sister{3}to obey me, if you hope{3}to keep her from harm.{2}
{17}{6}{5}, please...{3}Just do as she says{3}for now.{2}
{17}{5}{5}.{5}.{5}.{2}
It's all right, {17}{6}.{2}
{17}{1} and {17}{2}{3}shouldn't have come after{3}us...{2}
I'm sorry, {17}{1},{3}{17}{2}...{2}
I'm counting on you!{2}
{17}{1}! {17}{2}!{3}Don't{5} die!{2}
{17}{6}... {3}Kraden!{2}
If you want to save{3}them, you'll have to{3}beat me, first!{2}
No! Get back!{2}
What's the matter!{2}
Saturos is extremely{3}powerful. I could sense{3}it when I faced him.{2}
You have to be very{3}careful when fighting him...{1}We have to match{3}his strength...{2}
Match me?{5} Pah! You{3}think you can match{3}the great Saturos?{30}
You overestimate{3}your chances.{2}
And yet you still want{3}to fight? Ship of fools...{2}
Fine then... I'll just{3}teach you all a lesson!{2}
What happened? Saturos{3}is moving strangely.{2}
What's this!? The light of{3}Mercury... It's{3}weakening my Psynergy!{2}
I must finish this{3}quickly... Come on, fools!{2}
{17}{1}, we got him!{2}
Who would have thought{3}that Mercury Lighthouse{3}held such great power?{1}If only my Psynergy had{3}been at its full power...{2}
Saturos... You said{3}you were weakened.{3}What did you mean?{2}
I{5}.{5}.{5}.{5} I meant nothing...{2}
I shall tell you{3}what he means...{2}
That voice! Could it be?{2}
Alex!{2}
It's been a while, {17}{4}.{2}
Alex, do you realize{3}what you've done?{2}
Ha! Of course... I have{3}freed a great power that{3}has long been sealed away.{2}
Mercury, the lighthouse{3}of Water...{3}What a mighty force.{2}
Alex, you...{3}Are you mad!?{2}
No, {17}{4}...{3}Don't you understand?{2}
The lighthouse granted{3}you great power during{3}your battle with Saturos.{2}
It's true...{3}I could use my power{3}without ever depleting it.{2}
Don't you see?{1}The Mercury Lighthouse{3}supplied you with{3}limitless Psynergy.{2}
Psynergy? Are you telling{3}me my powers come{3}from Psynergy?{2}
You and I are both{3}members of Mercury{3}Clan...{1}Masters of Water{3}Psynergy.{2}
{17}{4} is an Adept{3}too, isn't she?{30}
Geez, {17}{1}, you knew{3}all along, and you{3}didn't tell us?{2}
I know it's hard to{3}believe, but it looks like{3}{17}{4}'s one of us.{2}
Tell me, Alex...{3}Why wasn't Saturos able{3}to use his full power?{2}
Ah, yes...{3}I shall explain it all.{2}
Saturos is aligned with{3}Mars, the clan of fire.{2}
Fire and water are{3}opposing elements...{1}His full power was bound{3}by the Water Psynergy{3}of the lighthouse.{2}
Didn't Saturos{3}know that?{2}
Of course he knew.{2}
However, he failed to{3}appreciate the power{3}of this lighthouse.{2}
As did I...{2}
Is that why we were{3}able to defeat Saturos?{2}
No...{3}There is more to it.{2}
I stood by, watching your{3}battle from afar...{2}
You were watching us?{2}
Yes. I did not help{3}Saturos, because I was{3}certain he would win.{2}
But I was wrong... You{3}have become such great{3}fighters in a short time.{2}
Saturos is up again!?{3}But we beat him!{2}
Me? Beaten? Never!{3}I lost to this lighthouse,{3}not to you!{2}
I was merely stalling you{3}until Saturos regained{3}his strength.{2}
You were just buying{3}time! That's not fair,{3}Alex!{2}
I won't let Saturos{3}escape!{2}
And just what are you{3}going to do? Will you{5}{3}finish him off?{30}
If that's the case,{3}you will have to fight{3}me, as well.{1}I've seen how you fight.{3}You cannot hope to win.{2}
Yes, {17}{1}. You seem{3}like a smart warrior.{1}You can't beat our{3}combined might, now that{3}we've seen how you fight.{2}
And I doubt you are{3}the type to 'finish'{3}anyone off!{2}
Of course, you are{3}welcome to believe{3}whatever you want.{2}
He warped again!{2}
Again?{5}{3}He's done that before?{2}
Yeah, in Sol Sanctum...{2}
That Psynergy...the warp.{3}Does that mean {17}{4}{3}can use it?{2}
No, it's impossible.{3}Even Alex didn't have{3}this kind of power before.{2}
Ah, well... I can't stay the{3}same Alex you knew{3}forever...{2}
Well, it seems that my{3}ride has returned while{3}we were speaking.{2}
And so, I bid you adieu.{2}
{17}{1}, Saturos{3}still has the{3}Elemental Stars!{2}
That's right!{3}We can't let them{3}leave now!{2}
Oh? And you want{3}to take the Elemental{3}Stars from Saturos?{30}
Ha! Too bad!{3}Menardi has them. You'll{3}have to ask her!{2}
Ha! You're right...{3}Menardi has the{3}Elemental Stars!{2}
That reminds me...{2}
Do you still have{3}the Mars Star?{30}
I appreciate your{3}honesty.{2}
Are you telling the truth?{3}Well, I shall believe you{3}for now.{2}
I suppose you'll be willing{3}to pursue us for the{3}Elemental Stars?{30}
I look forward to it.{3}I shall see you{3}soon, then.{2}
That's too bad...{3}I shall look forward to{3}seeing you again.{2}
Good-bye.{2}
I look forward to our{3}next battle.{2}
They're gone...{2}
Shoot... We couldn't even{3}save {17}{6}...{2}
I don't deserve to{3}be a healer...{2}
We couldn't stop them{3}from lighting the{3}beacon.{2}
I've failed my clan,{3}failed in my duty...{2}
That's not true!{3}We can still beat{3}them, right, {17}{1}?{30}
That's right, {17}{1}!{1}All we have to do is stop{3}them from lighting{3}all the lighthouses!{2}
You're not helping here!{1}We're fine as long as{3}the lighthouses aren't{3}all lit!{2}
The beacon of Mercury{3}Lighthouse has been lit,{1}but we'll stop{3}them next time.{2}
That's right. We can{3}save {17}{6} at the{3}next lighthouse.{2}
Yes. We won't let Alex{3}get away with this...{2}
Let's go after{3}them now!{2}
What's the matter?{3}We should hurry!{2}
We?{3}{17}{4}, are you{3}coming along with us?{2}
But the people of Imil{3}need you, {17}{4}.{2}
It's okay.{2}
"The fountain shall be{3}filled as long as light{3}fills the lighthouse."{1}That's an old saying.{3}The fountain will run over{3}with healing waters now.{2}
I have mixed feelings{3}about leaving, but Imil will{3}be fine as long as{1}the fountain continues{3}to flow with the{3}Water of Hermes.{2}
We should hurry if we're{3}going to follow them.{2}
The legends said that if{3}the lighthouse was lit, the{3}fountain would fill again!{1}It looks like the{3}legends were true!{2}
Our fountain is back! They{3}say these waters can{3}heal all that lives.{2}
I drank the healing water,{3}and now I feel great!{1}I should get a bottle{3}so I can take some{3}home with me.{2}
We don't have to fear{3}any epidemic as long as{3}we have our fountain.{2}
How did the fountain{3}know that the beacon{3}was lit?{2}
All that lives... That means{3}it must work on plants and{3}animals, too.{2}
I knew it would work, but{3}I never knew it would{3}work this well!{1}I feel ten years younger!{2}
I never believed those{3}stories, but there's{3}the proof!{2}
He who honors the heart{3}of the goddess shall stand{3}at the center of all,{1}like a swan in the{3}center of a rippling{3}pond.{2}
He who honors the{3}goddess of rainbows shall{1}be guided to the heavens{3}upon wings of fluid grace.{2}
The door is shut tight.{2}
The fountain is flowing{3}with water.{2}
The fountain seems dry.{2}
Strange forces are at{3}work... It seems{3}impossible to proceed.{2}
{18}{1} got{3}{20}{2}.{2}
Please, don't hide{3}anything. Just tell{3}me the truth!{30}
The Mercury Lighthouse{3}is shining.{1}{17}{4} will be leaving{3}us soon, won't she?{2}
Imil will be fine.{3}Disease is nothing to{3}the Water of Hermes.{2}
One,{5} two,{5} three,{5} four...{2}
I was training hard so{3}that I could withstand{3}any disease...{1}And now the lighthouse{3}fountain is back?{30}
What did I train{3}so hard for all this time?{2}
No, it can't be! Everyone{3}is in perfect health!{2}
{17}{4} was only in Imil{3}to guard the lighthouse.{1}Now that it's been lit,{3}she'll probably leave us.{2}
Don't worry about us,{3}{17}{4}. We'll protect{3}the village now!{2}
Now that I've let my{3}guard down, I'm getting{3}cold chills.{1}Maybe I should go{3}and drink some of{3}that fountain water.{2}
That fountain water really{3}made Grandpa healthy.{2}
Did I really say{3}I was going to die{3}from that disease?{30}
Ha ha ha! I must have{3}really felt sick to{3}say that!{1}I'm good for another 30{3}years!{5} ...Let me get{3}back to work!{2}
That's right!{3}The strong old man of{3}Imil, that's me!{2}
Grandpa's all better{3}now, thanks to that{3}fountain water.{2}
Now, {17}{4} can leave{3}the village without any{3}worries.{2}
It's nice that the fountain{3}can heal us, but {17}{4} had{3}something...special.{2}
That blue light from her{3}hands... Could she really{3}be an angel?{2}
I have to catch up{3}on lost opportunity!{3}It's time for business!{2}
Customers are hard to{3}come by, and I can't{3}afford to lose even one!{2}
It's a shame the store{3}was closed for something{3}as minor as a cold.{2}
The customers are back!{3}I thought I'd lost my{3}business for good.!{2}
I'm fully recovered,{3}thanks to the fountain!{3}I can get back to work!{2}
I'm so happy that{3}Mommy is well again!{2}
{17}{4} said it wouldn't be{3}good to leave the{3}lighthouse lit...{1}But it turned out to be{3}the best thing for Imil.{2}
My daddy's still in Kolima.{3}I'll be really happy{3}if he comes home soon!{2}
It's almost time for you{3}to leave, isn't it?{30}
Just like the legend said,{3}the fountain began flowing{3}when the light was lit.{1}That means that Imil{3}needs never fear{3}disease again!{2}
Oh! I'll cook a feast{3}for you tonight!{2}
Thank goodness the town{3}is back to normal again.{2}
I'm glad the beacon has{3}been lit and the fountain{3}is flowing again.{1}But it's a shame that {17}{4}{3}is leaving the village...{2}
{17}{4} will be{3}leaving with you all...{1}I wish you could{3}stay a little longer...{2}
They came to our village{3}and now the fountain{3}is flowing.{1}They must truly be{3}our lucky charms.{2}
I never told {17}{4}{3}that I liked her...{1}But I guess it's for{3}the best.{2}
{17}{4}...{2}
We were worried that{3}you wouldn't come back!{2}
I'm so sorry,{3}you two...{2}
{17}{4}, we have a problem!{3}The Mercury Lighthouse...{3}It's been lit!{2}
{17}{4}, you already knew?{2}
What's the matter?{5}{3}You look strange{3}today, {17}{4}.{2}
I...{5}{3}How should I tell you?{2}
You have something to{3}say? What is it?{2}
Well, {5}I... Uh...{2}
I...{5} I'll be joining{3}{17}{1} on his quest.{2}
It's very hard for{3}me to leave you, but{5}{3}it's the lighthouse.{2}
You said the world would{3}be in danger if the{3}lighthouse was lit, right?{2}
Is that why you're{3}leaving? To protect the{3}world?{2}
Yes.{5} That's right...{2}
Then there's nothing{3}we can do...{2}
We won't try{3}to stop you, then.{1}After all, you are{3}trying to protect{3}the Mercury Clan.{2}
Yes.{5} I am...{2}
As members of the{3}Mercury Clan...we will{3}protect Imil ourselves.{1}So don't worry, OK?{2}
I will try hard and{3}learn to heal as well{3}as you, {17}{4}!{2}
OK, I'll leave the{3}village in your hands,{3}Megan, Justin...{2}
We can leave{3}without any worries, now.{2}
I will be the healer,{3}because I know how, OK?{2}
{17}{4}'s going on a{3}journey with you, right?{1}Sniff... It makes me sad,{3}but I'll try to be a{3}good healer.{2}
I will be a kind girl,{3}like {17}{4}.{1}Come back sometime{3}and see me all grown up.{3}I want you to.{2}
{17}{4}'s going to defend{3}the honor of the{3}Mercury Clan.{2}
I'm sorry, {17}{4}, but{3}I can't stand to{3}see you go.{2}
If I could speak, I'd{3}tell them this is Kolima,{3}village of lumberjacks!{2}
How could anyone turn a{3}girl as beautiful as{3}me into a tree?{1}Actually, I'm pretty{3}cute for a tree.{2}
This is a dream...{3}It has to be a dream...{2}
Being unable to move{3}is so inconvenient.{2}
I am old; I've lived{3}a full life. I don't{3}even mind being a tree.{1}I just feel bad for all{3}those kids who were{3}turned into trees.{2}
It's the sacred tree's{3}curse! Why did they{3}try to cut down Tret?{2}
The water at my feet...{3}{5}Huh?{5} Hey!{5} It's delicious!{2}
If I can't move,{3}then Mom can't make{3}me go to bed!{2}
What are they staring at?{3}They seem awfully{3}young...{1}They don't stand a{3}chance against Tret.{2}
I dreamt that a mighty{3}warrior with a thick{3}beard ended this curse.{1}I dream about him{3}a lot, actually...{2}
What will happen to my{3}treasure if I'm stuck as{3}a tree forever?{2}
Soon, all of Kolima will{3}be nothing but forest...{2}
I wonder what Father's{3}secret is...{2}
Maybe we turned into{3}trees because of all the{3}trees we've cut down.{1}We were only doing{3}our jobs, though.{2}
At least my father wasn't{3}the one who tried to cut{3}down the holy tree.{2}
The holy tree of Kolima{3}has great powers, just{3}like Father said.{2}
I used to carve{3}weapons out of wood.{3}Now I am wood.{1}Life's funny{3}like that.{2}
Man... I'm stuck inside.{3}That means I can't even{3}become a tall tree.{2}
No! I don't want to{3}be stuck as a tree{3}forever!{2}
Maybe if I meditate{3}harder, I'll turn{3}back into a man...{1}Ngg{5} Ung!!{5} Ugagaga!!!{2}
Who caused all this?{3}Someone must have tried{3}to cut down Tret!{2}
How am I supposed to{3}charge people for their{3}rooms if I'm a tree!?{2}
The villagers were right.{3}I never should have tried{3}to cut that tree down.{1}Now I'll never see{3}my family in Imil{3}again...{2}
If only I'd left town{3}a day earlier. But this{3}room was so comfy!{2}
This is Kolima,{3}village of lumberjacks!{3}I'll shout it out loud!{1}This{5} is{5} Ko{5}li{5}ma!{2}
We rely on the forests{3}so much, and yet we hurt{3}the sacred tree...{1}Maybe we can work{3}to restore harmony{3}in the forest now.{2}
You know, being a tree{3}gives you a lot of{3}time to think.{2}
I turned into a tree right{3}when the sparkles fell{3}from the sky.{2}
Don't blame the villagers{3}for being tempted by{3}McCoy's money...{1}Anyone would be tempted{3}by such a staggering sum.{2}
Who would try to use{3}the holy tree to build{3}a palace, anyway?{2}
I didn't mind being{3}a tree...{1}Water never tasted{3}so good!{2}
Yawn... Trees are so...{3}sleepy...{2}
For a while I thought I'd{3}never be able to say this,{3}but I have to say it!{1}I've been waiting all of{3}my life for this moment!{2}
The forest trees are{3}alive, just as we are...{2}
I wonder if I'd live{3}longer if I were still{3}a tree.{2}
If those sparkles start{3}falling again, I'm heading{3}for the hills.{2}
I've been poor all my life.{1}That's why it bothers me{3}that McCoy thinks money{3}can solve everything.{2}
It's not called the holy{3}tree for nothing.{1}We should have been{3}more respectful.{2}
If we were all trees,{3}there'd be no more wars.{5}{3}'Cause we'd be trees.{2}
Nobody yells at you when{3}you're a tree...{1}And nobody makes you go{3}to bed early, either.{2}
I heard that traveling{3}warriors from the Goma{3}Range saved the village.{1}The warriors are said to{3}be enormously huge and{3}very strong.{1}They supposedly defeated{3}Tret to remove the curse.{2}
Big, strong warriors{3}with great beards freed{3}Kolima from the curse.{1}If you see them, please{3}thank them for me.{2}
I don't really know,{3}but you should be able{3}to tell travelers.{2}
All warriors are big,{3}and all warriors have{3}huge beards.{2}
You saved Kolima? Wow!{3}That makes me want to{3}tell you a secret!{1}But I'm not gonna. It's{3}too good to give away!{2}
My husband seems to be{3}keeping a secret{3}from me.{2}
Daddy told me his secret.{2}
It's hidden deep in{3}the forest, but I can't{3}tell him that!{2}
I think he found something{3}valuable, but where{3}could he be hiding it?{2}
Still, telling me it's{3}outside the village{3}doesn't help much...{2}
I'm never going to{3}use an axe again.{2}
Dad, will you please{3}go back to being a{3}lumberjack?{2}
Dad! How are we going{3}to eat if you don't work?{2}
People turned into trees{3}because of my axe. I will{3}never use an axe again.{2}
Knowing my Dad, he'll{3}start working again once{3}he gets hungry.{2}
How am I supposed to{3}grow up if I don't{3}eat?{1}If he's not gonna feed me,{3}I'm not gonna obey him!{2}
Fuchin Temple is on the{3}other side of the river.{3}It's quite famous.{1}You should visit it if{3}you have any spare{3}time.{2}
Fuchin Temple's Master{3}Nyunpa is said to be a{3}strange one...{2}
The grand bridge across{3}the river is the{3}pride of Kolima.{2}
It's a shame we had to{3}cut down so many trees{3}to build that bridge.{2}
When I was a tree,{3}I learned to appreciate{3}the sun.{2}
It felt so good{3}when my leaves were{3}bathed in sunlight.{2}
I am told the holy tree's{3}rage caused this{3}horrible incident...{1}Do you believe that{3}was the only cause?{30}
You may not have noticed,{3}but something changed{3}when those gems landed.{2}
I agree. Something did{3}change when the gems fell.{2}
If the holy tree alone{3}caused all this, then I've{3}failed in my duty.{1}I should have stopped{3}them from cutting down{3}the tree.{2}
They say that McCoy{3}halted construction of{3}the palace.{1}With no more work, all{3}the lumberjacks that came{3}to make money will leave.{2}
With no more work here,{3}Kolima can go back to{3}being a quiet little village.{2}
I've been a lumberjack{3}for years, but I've never{3}seen anything like this.{1}I think I'll go home{3}to my family in Imil.{2}
I'm only a merchant, but{3}I got turned into a tree{3}just for staying here.{1}I think I'll head to Xian,{3}south of the river, now{3}that I'm a man again.{2}
The village was really{3}booming with all that{3}work...{1}But what good is it if{3}you get turned into a{3}tree.{2}
Remaining a quiet village{3}means remaining poor.{1}I was hoping Kolima{3}would flourish with all{3}the construction.{2}
I'm a lumberjack,{3}and I'm okay{5} with that.{2}
I wish I'd grabbed{3}some of those gems{3}that fell from the sky.{1}They must be{3}worth a fortune!{2}
I was turned into{3}a tree for a while...{3}Can you believe it?{30}
I think I now know what{3}it means to sink your{3}roots in one place.{1}But I wouldn't recommend{3}it to anyone else.{2}
Yeah, I can't even{3}believe it myself.{2}
Welcome to Bilibin.{5}{3}We'll forget that whole{3}curse business in no time!{2}
If you're talking about{3}the travelers from Imil,{3}they crossed the river.{2}
You're wondering about{3}the tree near the{3}village entrance?{1}It turned back{3}into a person. Thank{3}goodness!{2}
I saw Lord McCoy, the{3}chief of Bilibin,{3}walking through town{1}for the first time in{3}a long while...{1}He must be relieved{3}to see that the curse{3}has been broken.{2}
I hear the barricade gate{3}that blocked the road{3}to Kolima is open again.{2}
Those three kids vanished{3}during all that trouble{3}with the curse.{2}
The curse was broken{3}all thanks to the efforts{3}of three young warriors.{1}Say... You're not the{3}young warriors, are you?{30}
That's amazing! You broke{3}the so-called curse!{2}
I didn't think so. You{3}don't look very tough{3}at all.{2}
Lord McCoy's men said{3}they saw the ones who{3}saved the village.{2}
Have you ever been to{3}the village of Imil,{3}up north?{30}
Did you see the great{3}lighthouse over there?{3}I bet it was amazing!{2}
If you ever go there,{3}be sure to visit their{3}famous lighthouse.{2}
The eruption on the other{3}side of the mountains{3}seems to have stopped.{1}Things are finally{3}peaceful again.{2}
Now that the curse{3}is broken, why don't we{3}start construction again?{2}
It's over! Over! Milord{3}decided not to{3}build the palace.{2}
Hmph! My palace is not{3}finished!{1}McCoy loves that holy{3}tree more than he{3}loves me!{2}
I never want to be{3}turned into a tree again.{3}It was terrible.{2}
Not many lumberjacks are{3}willing to cut trees in{3}Kolima forest anymore.{2}
One of the two people{3}that came later was{3}apparently injured...{2}
That guy might turn{3}into a tree again if you{3}go near him...{2}
Lord McCoy seems to be{3}having a spat with his{3}wife. I wonder who'll win?{2}
Apparently, just about{3}anyone could just waltz{3}through that barricade.{2}
"The Gang of Three"{24}HA!{3}They're probably just{3}dozing somewhere.{2}
I'm sure Lord McCoy will{3}give you a great reward!{3}I wonder what it will be!{2}
They must be reporting{3}your deeds to Lord{3}McCoy right now!{2}
I want to share with you{3}this sense of joy{3}that I feel!{2}
As long as I'm okay, I{3}really don't care what{3}happens to anyone else.{2}
We'd still be working{3}if we hadn't tried building{3}using the holy tree.{1}I told them{3}not to use it.{2}
That was close!{1}Building a cursed{3}palace looks really{3}bad on your resume.{2}
He said he stopped{3}construction so that I{3}would not be cursed...{1}I think he's just{3}trying to weasel out{3}of his promise!{2}
Do you know if the{3}holy tree survived?{30}
That makes sense. Those{3}who were turned into{3}trees are back to normal.{1}I am sure the holy tree{3}of Kolima Forest{3}survived, too!{2}
Then how did the people{3}who became trees get{3}returned to normal?{1}Did we just imagine{3}the whole thing?{2}
Thank goodness they{3}stopped construction{3}of the palace.{1}Lady McCoy seemed very{3}disappointed, though.{2}
It takes many years for a{3}tree to grow so old{3}that it becomes holy.{1}No human should{3}ever kill a tree as{3}precious as that.{2}
Sometimes, I wish I could{3}see what the palace{3}would have been like.{2}
I always miss Altin{3}in the winter.{1}I used to work there in{3}the mines, and the winters{3}were always so warm.{2}
My father says that it's{3}warm all year long on the{3}other side of the river.{2}
I wonder if there are{3}still beautiful gems in{3}Altin Mine...{2}
My father has traveled{3}all over the world.{2}
The road to Kolima is{3}open again. You can finally{3}continue on your journey.{2}
Do you know what silk is?{30}
That's what they make in{3}Xian village on the other{3}side of the river.{1}The long road that runs{3}from there is called{3}Silk Road.{2}
Caterpillars are raised{3}on mulberry leaves.{1}When the caterpillars'{3}cocoons are unwound,{3}they become silk thread.{1}The thread is then woven{3}into cloth used{3}to make clothing{1}for wealthy people like{3}Lady McCoy.{2}
Traveling makes young{3}warriors stronger.{2}
Clothes made with silk{3}are so smooth and shiny.{2}
I thought I saw lights in{3}the sky over Imil last{3}night.{1}Could the legendary{3}lighthouse have been...?{2}
His eyes are red{3}because he stayed up{3}late last night.{2}
There's no doubt about it!{3}It's the light from the{3}lighthouse near Imil.{2}
What's the big deal? Why{3}are you making a fuss{3}about a lighthouse?{2}
Our weapons are the best{3}you can find...{1}But you should also try{3}the store in Altin, south{3}of the river.{2}
Altin's got good weapons,{3}but I still think my{3}selection is better.{2}
For some reason, the{3}ocean fills me with{3}hope and desire...{1}If you ever see the{3}ocean, remember men like{3}me, who dream about it.{2}
I wish I could go out{3}onto the ocean! Maybe I{3}should go on a journey...{1}But no, I don't have{3}that kind of courage.{2}
It turned out that all{3}the warriors hired by{3}Lord McCoy were useless!{1}Except for those cute{3}warriors who removed the{3}curse, that is.{2}
They call themselves{3}warriors...{1}but you can't count on{3}any of them in real{3}emergencies.{2}
Wasn't that curse in{3}Kolima horrifying?{30}
Even heroes like{3}you can feel fear.{1}Just imagine how{3}scary it was for us{3}poor townsfolk.{2}
You can say that now,{3}because it's all over.{1}At the time, we{3}were all scared out{3}of our pants.{2}
There will be fewer{3}guests now that the{3}fuss is over.{1}Whoever ended the{3}curse sure didn't do{3}us any favors.{2}
Two specials! One dinner!{3}One sandwich! One{3}dessert! Hurry up!{2}
Hey, you! Are you done{3}yet?{2}
Almost...{2}
If you want a meal,{3}speak to the waitress.{2}
I really think the{3}head chef has changed.{3}It's too much!{2}
I can't keep up{3}with his energy!{2}
Let's see, serve them{3}water...then get the{3}silverware.{2}
The head chef will yell{3}if you slow down...{2}
I'm a little surprised{3}that the head chef{3}is working so hard.{2}
There's no business{3}here, so I'm heading south{3}of the river to Xian.{1}Perhaps I'll take Silk{3}Road as far as Tolbi.{2}
They served so much food{3}today!{1}If they do that{3}every day, they won't{3}make any money!{2}
That was some meal!{3}Don't you just love{3}the food here?{30}
I know how you feel.{3}Go find a table{3}and pig out!{2}
What!? Why am I even{3}talking to you, when{3}I could be eating!?{2}
Ooooh...{5} That's it...{3}I tried my best, but I{3}couldn't eat another bite...{2}
The incident was resolved{3}before I knew it...{1}Maybe I'll head south of{3}the river to find{3}another job.{2}
I wonder what that eerie{3}howling coming from south{3}of the river was...{1}It really gave me{3}the heebie-jeebies.{2}
Well, I was only acting{3}scared so that I'd fit in.{3}I wasn't really scared.{2}
It'd be better for{3}business if the curse had{3}not been broken so fast.{2}
I'll go to Kolima when{3}the customers are gone.{1}But in the meantime,{3}I'll cook like there's{3}no tomorrow!{2}
Let's see... Soup...{3}salad...and...{3}I forgot the dressing.{2}
The head chef was so{3}lazy until just the{3}other day, but all of{1}a sudden, I'm having{3}trouble keeping up with{3}how much he's changed.{2}
It used to take them so{3}long to serve your order,{3}but not anymore!{2}
When they stopped{3}building the palace, I{3}lost all my business.{1}Maybe I'll buy some silk in{3}Xian and sell it in Tolbi.{2}
I wish I could eat like{3}this all the time!{2}
I'd better eat a lot; that{3}chef's gonna burn out{3}in no time at this rate!{2}
The food is such a good{3}value at this price!{2}
If a kid like this could{3}end the curse, maybe I{3}could have done the job.{2}
It looks like scary{3}things are happening all{3}over the world...{2}
The curse may be over,{3}but we can't drop our{3}guard yet.{1}It's still not entirely safe{3}wandering outside of{3}town.{2}
How about that? Our{3}wishes have come true.{2}
The signs of danger are{3}actually more numerous{3}than they were before.{2}
Peace will be kept{3}as long as we continue{3}our meditations.{2}
Oh!{5} It's...{2}
Oh! Sir!{2}
We've been looking{3}everywhere for you!{2}
The curse of the holy{3}tree... {5}You're the ones{3}who broke it, right?{30}
That's not true. We have{3}witnesses who say they{3}saw you in the forest!{2}
It was you, wasn't it?{30}
You're under arrest!{2}
Let's go.{3}Lord McCoy is waiting.{2}
We've brought the{3}warriors, milord.{2}
We brought the warriors,{3}as you ordered, milord.{2}
So{5}, yeh're the wee{5}{24}I{3}mean, brave{24}lads I{3}met before!{2}
So{5}, yeh're the wee{5}{24}I{3}mean, brave{24}lads who{3}saved Kolima?{2}
What were yer{3}names, again?{2}
What are yer{3}names, then?{2}
He's {17}{1}, sir,{3}and I'm {17}{2}...{2}
I am called {17}{3}.{2}
And I am {17}{4}, from{3}the village of Imil.{2}
{17}{1} and company...{2}
And did I not decline{3}yer offer when we{3}first met?{30}
I did nae give it enough{3}consideration back then.{2}
Are yeh no' just sayin'{3}that tae appease me?{2}
And yet yeh went oan tae{3}break the curse despite{3}my words, did yeh not?{30}
Are yeh no' the ones{3}who ended the curse{3}of the holy tree?{30}
I humbly thank you.{2}
Nae, yeh dinnae need tae{3}hide it.{5} My men told{3}me aught yeh did.{2}
I was but worried yeh{3}might nae stop here{3}on yer way back.{2}
I want tae show my{3}appreciation for yer{3}help...{2}
I relied oan my money,{5}{3}but I forgot about{3}my people's needs.{2}
Yeh reminded me{3}of my duties.{2}
As lord of these lands, I{3}will do my best for{3}everyone's behalf.{2}
{17}{1}, it would honor me{3}greatly if yeh'd accept a wee{3}token of my gratitude.{2}
I could give it tae yeh{3}here, but would yeh no'{3}rather choose it yerself?{30}
Very well. Yeh can choose{3}somethin' that'll help{3}yeh along yer way.{2}
Words are nae enough{3}tae express my regret{3}in doubting yeh.{1}Please, choose a token{3}in thanks for yer{3}service.{2}
I will show {17}{1} and{3}his friends the way,{3}milord.{2}
Many thanks tae yeh,{3}and tae yer companions,{3}as well!!{2}
Visit me anytime!{5} Yeh'll{3}always find a warm{3}hearth here!{2}
Follow me, and I'll{3}take you to the{3}treasure room.{2}
Lord McCoy ordered that{3}{17}{1} and his companions{3}be brought here.{1}Please show them{3}their reward!{2}
You may select a single{3}item from among these{3}four chests.{2}
Please take your reward{3}before your depart!{2}
You are always welcome in{3}the palace of Lord McCoy.{2}
These courageous{3}warriors deserve to{3}receive milord's treasure.{2}
You may choose only one{3}item, but I trust that all{3}of them will prove useful.{2}
Nonetheless...if your luck{3}is sour, you may end up{3}an item you do not need.{2}
{16} checked{3}the chest...{1}but it was empty.{2}
The treasure chest{3}is locked.{2}
Yeh've taught me that I{3}cannae judge a man by his{3}age or appearance.{2}
You{5} are a fine warrior.{2}
Do you think I can{3}become as fine a{3}warrior as you?{30}
Really?{5} Then I will try{3}my best!{2}
Don't be so harsh...{5}{3}Just say yes, even if{3}you don't mean it.{2}
I could never have gone{3}to the village of Kolima{3}knowing the danger.{1}You are truly courageous{3}warriors.{2}
But I cannae figger out{3}how ye got past the{3}barricade...{1}when yeh did nae{3}e'en have the key...{2}
Sometimes, we need{3}children to remind us of{3}our own responsibilities.{2}
I will be a reliable{3}warrior, like {17}{1}{3}and his companions.{2}
Don't leave, {17}{1}!{3}Be my mentor, and{3}teach me to be brave!{2}
The people of Bilibin{3}will never forget{3}your bravery.{2}
I heard you received{3}a spectacular reward.{1}I hope that shows you{3}how nice Lord McCoy{3}really can be.{2}
Lady McCoy is quite{3}upset that the palace{3}construction was halted.{1}You probably won't want{3}to approach her for a{3}while.{2}
Things are looking grim{3}south of Goma Range...{3}Black clouds are looming.{1}If you're headed that{3}way, be prepared for{3}rain.{2}
Milady was very upset{3}when she left the room.{5}{3}Oh my...{2}
I feel sorry for the{3}warriors Lord{3}McCoy hired.{1}Milord will have strong{3}words for them if they{3}ever come back.{2}
I wonder what kind of{3}treasure Lord McCoy{3}gave them...{2}
I wish she'd just{3}stop whining...{1}I don't have a palace{3}either, and you don't{3}see me crying about it.{2}
They'd be guaranteed a{3}good life if they stayed in{3}Bilibin under the trust of{1}Lord McCoy. I wonder{3}why they travel on{3}as warriors.{2}
I can tell when she's{3}upset{24}she always{3}slams the door.{2}
For once, milord didn't{3}let Lady McCoy push{3}him around!{1}He seems much more{3}dashing now... Hee hee!{2}
AAAAH!!!{2}
Oh!{5} For a second, I{3}thought you were milady.{1}You really startled me!{2}
Sometimes, a man's just{3}gotta put his foot down.{3}And oh! What a man!{2}
The hole in this nightgown{3}is just getting bigger.{1}Has somebody else{3}been wearing it?{2}
It's very reckless for{3}such young warriors to{3}face the holy tree...{2}
I was watching from here.{3}After all that fuss,{3}you still went to Kolima?{30}
I don't know how you{3}removed the curse,{3}but you're the best!{2}
You lie! I saw you{3}walking through the{3}barricade!{1}And then I saw you again,{3}coming back through after{3}the forest turned green!{2}
You looked very{3}courageous walking{3}toward Kolima.{2}
A courageous warrior{3}wouldn't think twice about{3}being turned into a tree.{2}
The reward you received{3}was indeed the greatest{3}of treasures.{1}Courageous people{3}have the best luck!{2}
You got a pretty nice{3}reward, but I think you{3}were just unlucky.{1}I don't want you to{3}feel bad, so I'll tell{3}you something good.{2}
Oh, it looks like{3}she is okay.{2}
They crossed the river{3}after pushing us down.{1}This is terrible!{3}How could anyone{3}do that?{2}
She'll be swept{3}downstream if she isn't{3}pulled to shore!{2}
AHHHH! Please! Anyone!{3}Please help!{2}
Thank you! You saved{3}me from being washed{3}downstream!{2}
Hey!{5} You're that guy!{2}
Jill, are these the{3}people who saved you?{2}
Remember me?{3}I was that tree!{2}
I would have been swept{3}down the river if{3}it wasn't for you.{2}
Please,{5} take this.{5}{3}It is a small token of{3}my appreciation.{2}
Jill gave {17}{1} a{3}special gift.{2}
I will never forget what{3}you've done for me.{3}Thank you so much!{2}
It was awful luck,{3}being turned into{3}trees just then.{1}We just wanted to pick{3}persimmons. Who knew{3}what would happen?{2}
I really like this spot{3}by the riverbank...{3}My heart feels at peace.{2}
I will think of you{3}whenever I eat{3}persimmons.{2}
I heard we were once{3}called the Gang of Three.{1}But now that she's gone,{5}{3}we're just the Gang of{3}Two...{1}The poor girl...{2}
If only we hadn't tried{3}getting those persimmons,{3}she'd still be...{1}We'll never climb on each{3}other's shoulders again...{2}
Whose idea was it to{3}pick persimmons,{3}anyway?{2}
Well, it wasn't my{3}idea to go pick{3}persimmons.{2}
These persimmons are{3}just like my memories...{3}So{5} bitter...{2}
We worked so hard...{3}If only we had been{3}a little faster...{2}
What a cruel world! We{3}just wanted to climb on{3}one another's shoulders!{2}
Are you going to cross{3}the bridge?{2}
Oh...{5}{5} Right!{3}Go right ahead!{2}
For a while, I thought{3}no one would ever cross{3}this bridge again.{1}Enjoy every crossing,{3}for it could be your last!{2}
You wouldn't understand,{3}but it's truly a joy{3}to cross this bridge.{2}
How did you get here?{3}Is the bridge open again?{30}
Really?!{5} Then I can{3}go home to Kolima now?{1}I thought I'd never go{3}home, what with the{3}cursed forest and all!{2}
Oh... Then you came{3}through the forest?{3}That's too bad.{2}
I beginning to think{3}I'll be stuck in Fuchin{3}Temple until I die.{2}
Did you know that the{3}forest up ahead used to{3}be a vast prairie?{30}
They say the prairie became{3}a vast forest overnight.{1}Nyunpa is the only person{3}who can pass through the{3}forest now...{1}Even Nyunpa doesn't{3}know why the prairie{3}turned into a forest.{2}
You don't believe me, do{3}you? Well, it's the truth.{1}You see, these gems fell{3}from the sky, and{3}the next day,{1}there was a forest{3}where the prairie{3}used to be.{2}
Om...{5} Om...{3}Blue lights in the north...{3}Terrifying!!!{1}A rain of broken stars...{3}A forest suddenly grows...{3}All omens...{2}
Gems from the sky,{3}blue lights in the north...{3}All omens of disaster!{1}They match legends of{3}destruction described in{3}our oldest scrolls.{2}
Nyunpa has not eaten in{3}days... He is going to{3}waste away to nothing.{2}
Isn't it noble of him to{3}try to save the world by{3}becoming enlightened?{30}
However, I really do{3}not want to see{3}Nyunpa waste away.{2}
Do you know what you{3}mean when you say that?{30}
Well,{5} one may have many{3}different opinions{3}in this world,{5} but...{1}I wish you could{3}understand our beliefs.{2}
To achieve enlightenment,{3}one fasts to cleanse{3}body and mind...{1}Freed from worldly{3}concerns, one can focus{3}the mind's powers.{2}
I don't feel safe going{3}home alone... I hope a{3}monk will escort me.{2}
Many stars fell from the{3}sky, just as it says{3}in the scrolls...{1}Is this truly a{3}portent of the world's{3}destruction?{2}
There is no point in{3}training if the world{3}is to be destroyed.{1}Maybe it is better{3}just to live happily.{2}
I can't imagine fasting...{3}It gets me depressed just{3}thinking about it.{2}
I will train to{3}become a good monk.{1}Then, I will save the{3}world, even if I must{3}sacrifice myself.{2}
.{5}.{5}.{5}.{5}.{5}.{5}{2}
Mmmm... Who is that?{3}Who speaks to my mind?{2}
Young master... Was that{5}{3}your voice I heard{3}in my mind just now?{30}
Speak no lies to me!{2}
I knew it!{2}
I knew it!{2}
You follow{5} them,{5}{3}do you not?{30}
You speak lies...{3}You are indeed{3}following them!{2}
I knew it!{2}
But you must go{3}through Mogall Forest,{3}the endless woods.{1}The forest itself is a{3}mystery, and its paths{3}even more so...{1}No ordinary man can{3}pass from one side to{3}the other.{2}
But perhaps I could,{3}young master.{2}
If you can endure the{3}trials in the waterfall{3}grotto, I will tell you.{2}
Will you take the test?{30}
Then I cannot tell you.{3}Give up and go back{3}from whence you came.{2}
You must survive the{3}test of the grotto{3}before you can pass{1}through Mogall Forest.{3}Will you take the test?{30}
Do not worry. You will{3}be permitted to enter{3}the grotto.{2}
Go now,{5} {17}{1}!{2}
Just remember, you are{3}not the only ones{3}who can read minds.{2}
Speak to the monk{3}standing beneath the{3}falls.{2}
You enjoy reading the{3}minds of others, do{3}you not?{30}
If you overdo it, you{3}will soon learn to despise{3}the ability.{2}
That is good. Enjoy{3}reading the minds of{3}others while you still can.{2}
I have already heard of{3}your test from Master{3}Nyunpa. You may enter.{2}
The test of Fuchin Falls{3}is a difficult one. Do not{3}enter until you are ready.{2}
Can such young warriors{3}endure the trial of{3}the grotto?{2}
Young master, did you{3}complete the test?{30}
Why, you have mastered{3}the secrets of Fuchin{3}Temple!?{2}
But you must have...{2}
Master Nyunpa is waiting{3}for you...{2}
Proceed to the temple.{2}
Master Nyunpa is waiting{3}for you...{3}Proceed to the temple.{2}
The warriors have{3}mastered the secrets{3}of Fuchin Temple.{2}
Excellent, {17}{1}!{2}
I am glad to see you{3}master the secrets of{3}Fuchin Temple!{2}
We monks call the{3}power you have{3}obtained Ki.{2}
You seem{5} confused,{3}{17}{1}.{30}
This is called "force" by{3}the western world, but it{3}is really spiritual power.{2}
You possess great wisdom{3}for one so young, but I{3}feel I must explain this.{2}
It is called "force" by{3}the western world, but it{3}is really spiritual power.{2}
I will teach you, as I{3}promised. Use this power{3}to go through the forest.{2}
What would happen if you{3}let loose this energy{3}in the forest?{2}
Ha ha! You are{3}curious, no?{30}
I can read minds, you{3}know.{5} You are curious,{3}aren't you?{30}
Monsters that wait in{3}hiding would show{3}themselves.{1}You would then try to{3}defeat them, would you{3}not?{30}
Sometimes, you must let{3}go of your belief that{3}fighting solves problems...{2}
Ha ha... That is right.{3}There is no good in{3}wanton destruction.{2}
Monsters are cowardly.{3}They will run once they{3}know you can see them.{2}
They are creatures of the{3}woods... So they do not{3}get lost there.{2}
Use this energy to find{3}the monsters,{5} then follow{3}them. It is that simple.{2}
Now that I have passed{3}my knowledge of Ki{3}along...{1}I am without worries.{3}Farewell, {17}{1}.{3}Take care of yourself...{2}
Master Nyunpa seems{3}quite relieved.{1}Do not fail,{3}young warriors.{2}
We cannot sit idly by.{3}We too must learn the{3}secrets of Fuchin Temple.{2}
The Fuchin Temple{3}is a pleasant place.{3}I feel at peace here.{2}
Oh, {17}{1}! What took you so{3}long? Master Nyunpa has{3}become enlightened!{1}He no longer{3}responds to our words...{2}
Ahhh. Master Nyunpa...{3}He has passed away...{2}
Master Nyunpa has wasted{3}away at last.{2}
Now, he truly is beyond{3}the world's concerns.{3}Is he watching over us?{30}
I believed that once.{3}But now, I am no{3}longer so sure.{2}
Yes...{5} This seems{3}very wrong.{1}The world has lost{3}something great,{3}now that Nyunpa is gone...{2}
Gems falling from the sky,{3}mountains erupting,{3}oceans raging...{1}Fuchin Temple is the only{3}haven left for me in{3}such a frightful world.{2}
I knew Master Nyunpa{3}was fasting to save{3}the world...{1}even if it meant his own{3}death... But I am saddened{3}that he is gone...{2}
Master Nyunpa reached{3}enlightenment during his{3}lifetime. Amazing...{2}
Master Nyunpa is nothing{3}but skin and bones...{3}like a dried fish!{2}
He can't leave us yet...{3}He still has so much{3}to teach us!{2}
...............{2}
{17}{1}...{5} Is that you...?{5}{3}I am...{5}counting on you...{1}to bring peace...{5}{3}to the world...{2}
You don't have to try{3}so hard.{5} You are curious,{3}are you not?{30}
The dragon's flame{3}illuminates the path of{3}truth in darkness.{2}
The secret of Ki shall{3}be revealed to the{3}disciples of truth.{2}
Rays of light give{3}birth to shadows,{3}revealing the way.{2}
It's a statue of an{3}eyeless dragon.{1}What went in{3}the sockets?{2}
It's a statue of a dragon{3}with burning red eyes.{2}
The broken sign reads:{1}North: Fuchin Temple{3}South: Mogall Prairie...{2}
This is Xian. Travelers{3}are welcome here!{3}Relax. Stay long.{2}
Young warriors,{3}very gallant!{1}You came through{3}Mogall Forest?{30}
Incredible.{3}I respect your deeds.{2}
Came from Altin?{3}No. That is a lie.{1}Silk Road is blocked.{3}No one can come{3}that way.{2}
Xian is the village of{3}kinu. Kinu means silk.{3}Silk makes the best cloth.{2}
Do you know Master Feh?{30}
There are many scary{3}thieves now, but Master{3}Feh is scarier.{1}Xian is safe, because{3}thieves are afraid to go{3}near Master Feh.{2}
Master Feh is a martial{3}artist. He is very strong.{1}Master Feh teaches{3}martial arts at the Xian{3}school.{2}
Martial arts are very{3}popular in Xian.{1}All warriors should{3}learn martial arts.{2}
You warriors should visit{3}Master Feh's school.{3}You will be surprised!{2}
My clothes are not silk.{3}Silk is very expensive.{3}Only the wealthy wear it.{2}
Hoo-whaaa...{3}Hachaaa!{2}
Heh heh heh...{2}
My kung fu is strong.{1}If you go to Master Feh's{3}school every day, someday{3}you will be strong too.{2}
Disasters from the sky...{3}Many, many thieves...{1}But I do not worry. Xian{3}has many kung fu masters.{3}Master Feh is strong.{2}
This is the mulberry{3}orchard.{1}When the season comes,{3}all Xian comes to{3}harvest.{2}
You are the warriors{3}from the school... Are you{3}strong warriors?{30}
I am happy to see strong{3}warriors. I hope you will{3}go west.{2}
You are weak warriors?{3}Very few warriors would{3}call themselves weak.{2}
What are you doing! You{3}made me spill my water!{2}
Now I must get water{3}again. This work is{3}hard on my back.{2}
Do not speak to me.{3}I might spill my water.{2}
Wha{5}-Wha{5}-What happened?{3}The tree jumped on{3}its own!{2}
...It jumped again...{5}{3}I am too tired...{2}
These children must have{3}come to study kung fu{3}at Master Feh's School.{2}
You young warriors look{3}strong. But which is{3}stronger...{1}You, or the kung fu{3}taught at Master{3}Feh's school?{2}
I hope many people come{3}to know the silk of{3}Xian.{2}
Those who need no{3}weapons have true{3}strength.{1}Master Feh is number{3}one.{2}
Fighting with kicks and{3}punches is effective.{1}Everyone should{3}remember this.{2}
Master Feh's school is{3}training. It makes us{3}very strong.{2}
Silk is shiny and smooth.{3}It feels good on my skin.{3}I'm obsessed with it.{2}
Breaking trees with my{3}hand{5} hurts me very much.{1}But it does not hurt{3}Master Feh. He is a{3}great master.{2}
Master Feh said "YAH!"{3}and then the thieves fell.{2}
The orchard gives the{3}village life. It is very{3}precious to us.{2}
Going west alone is very{3}dangerous.{1}I must find someone to{3}take me west.{2}
I must carry water{3}every day. I can't{3}stand it!{2}
The mulberry harvest is{3}over. Now there is much{3}food for the caterpillars!{1}The cocoon threads will{3}become silk.{1}Merchants will buy a lot{3}when they come.{2}
Farm work is very hard.{3}Warriors have no idea{3}how hard it is.{2}
Soon, Master Hammet will{3}come. He will buy {3}much silk.{2}
Farm work is hard on the{3}shoulders. It is hard on{3}the back, too.{2}
Xian silk is sent on{3}Silk Road to Tolbi.{1}Tolbi is a big town{3}in the southwest.{2}
Silk Road ends in{3}Tolbi. It is a big,{3}big town.{2}
Silk Road is full{3}of silk merchants.{2}
Merchants say Tolbi is{3}very beautiful,{3}very wonderful...{2}
Follow Silk Road.{3}When you see the mountain{3}fork, go north.{1}Then you will see{3}Altin.{2}
There is a mine in Altin.{3}There is lots of steel{3}and lots of gems.{2}
Altin has many men.{3}All scary men, too.{2}
Mining is very hard work.{3}It takes great strength.{3}It is difficult for women.{2}
Xian has martial arts,{3}but kung fu alone is{3}not enough. People worry.{1}For that reason, it is{3}not strange to sell{3}weapons in Xian.{2}
Some say fighting with{3}weapons is cowardly.{3}I say not true.{1}There are many{3}fighters, and many ways{3}of fighting.{2}
Martial artists can't use{3}heavy armor. If they do,{3}they can't move quickly.{1}...But not warriors.{3}Using much armor is good{3}for them.{2}
In warrior battles, you{3}fight with weapons.{1}In kung fu, you fight{3}by dodging.{2}
Xian's special armor is{3}not suited to warriors...{1}It is better to buy{3}normal armor.{2}
Xian is a village of{3}craftsmen. They never buy{3}items. They make them.{2}
Warriors should learn{3}about the towns they{3}visit.{1}Just traveling and{3}fighting is a sad{3}life.{2}
Normally, many merchants{3}come to the village, but{3}they have not come yet.{1}I think{3}that is strange.{2}
All the people who came{3}to eat are from Xian.{3}What happened there?{2}
When you go to a new{3}place, follow the rules{3}in the new place.{1}This is an old{3}saying in Xian.{2}
When many merchants{3}come, my business{3}is good.{1}But if no merchants{3}come, my business is{3}very bad.{2}
There are fewer{3}travelers, so fewer{3}people eat here.{1}Where are all the{3}travelers?{2}
I came to Xian from very{3}distant lands to spread{3}good will.{2}
When you stay in Xian{3}for a long time, you{3}start to speak strangely.{1}My head gets very{3}confused...{2}
This is Master Feh's{3}school...{3}You came to watch?{30}
Promise me you will{3}be quiet.{2}
Warriors should learn{3}martial arts. They will{3}help in battles.{2}
Strong kicks are very{3}important.{3}Kick, kick, kick!{1}That is how you do it.{2}
I want to learn, so{3}I train. Quick punches{3}are very good.{1}Master Feh is very{3}good.{2}
Flexibility and jumping{3}are very important in{3}kung fu.{2}
Everyone in Xian can{3}do martial arts.{1}But the Feh School{3}of martial arts is{3}the most elite.{2}
Just listening does not{3}make one strong.{3}I learn by watching.{2}
Master Feh is very busy.{3}Do you still wish to{3}see him?{30}
Look there. You see that{3}line? Stand there and{3}use Chi.{1}If that tree falls, I will{3}take you to see{3}Master Feh.{2}
You will not see Master{3}Feh? That is{3}too bad.{2}
Master Feh is very busy.{3}He is speaking with his{3}daughter, Feizhi.{1}You cannot enter now.{2}
Warriors fight with{3}weapons. Kung fu means{3}little to you.{2}
Practicing kicks hurts{3}my feet very much.{3}But I still try hard.{2}
That punch was good!{3}You surprise me, warrior.{2}
I move too quickly.{3}You can't hit me with{3}your weapon. Try it.{2}
Warriors came to learn{3}the Feh School's kung fu.{3}That is how famous it is.{2}
Great kick. Kick from the{3}hip. That causes much pain{3}when it hits.{2}
You are the warriors who{3}came to study, yes?{1}It is too much to ask{3}to see Master Feh.{2}
Master Feh is talking{3}with Feizhi about{3}something very important.{1}You cannot disturb them.{2}
Ya! What happened!?{3}The tree fell on its own!{2}
You cannot push it with{3}your hands. Attack it{3}with Chi.{2}
What did you do,{3}warrior?{2}
The warrior used Chi!{3}He did it from the line...{3}and the tree fell!{2}
He knows kung fu!{3}Do you know kung fu?{30}
Your Chi must be{3}strong if you can{3}use it from afar.{1}I must tell Master Feh!{2}
It is unbelievable that{3}someone who does not{3}know kung fu can use Chi.{2}
Ya! What happened!?{3}The door opened on{3}its own!{2}
Feizhi! Wait!{2}
Are you worried{3}that Hsu is late?{2}
He is only a little late{3}in returning from Lama{3}Temple. Do not worry!{2}
Something is wrong with{3}Hsu... I sense it.{2}
Ahhh, Feizhi...{3}Is it your power again?{2}
Ever since gems fell from{3}the sky and hit me, I{3}have sensed bad things.{2}
You say you sense evil{3}ever since you received{3}the power of prophecy.{1}You have told{3}me already.{2}
I do not believe it, Feizhi.{3}Your visions are just{3}coincidences.{2}
My visions came true{3}many times, no?{2}
I had a vision about{3}Mogall Forest, and that{3}came true...{2}
Yes, your predictions{3}came true, Feizhi. It was{3}very surprising!{2}
The flood in Altin...{3}Did I not predict{3}that, too?{2}
All Feizhi's predictions{3}come true.{2}
See, Father?{2}
I have heard this all.{3}I was surprised, too, but{3}it is still coincidence.{2}
You still don't{3}believe it?{2}
Hsu is late, so you{3}worry too much. But do{3}not think bad thoughts.{2}
You sent people to{3}find Hsu, correct?{2}
Stubborn old man.{2}
What did you say, Feizhi?{3}You should not speak{3}so to your elders.{2}
I will not ask anyone.{3}I will go alone, then!{2}
It is too dangerous.{2}
Ya! Master Feh!{3}Feizhi has gone!{2}
Feizhi was very angry.{3}She was frightening!{2}
Hsu is in danger.{3}Feizhi is going to help.{2}
Feizhi knows kung fu.{3}She will be all right.{2}
Feizhi is alone. She{3}cannot go too far.{2}
She will give up soon{3}enough. Until then,{3}let her be.{2}
The tree... It fell.{3}What happened?{2}
The warrior did it.{3}He used Chi.{2}
Warrior, you...{3}Can you use Chi?{30}
Do it again, warrior.{3}Show me your Chi.{2}
Warrior, you speak{3}nonsense. You used Chi.{3}Do it again!{30}
Show me your Chi,{3}warrior.{2}
I want to see your{3}Chi, warrior.{2}
Warrior, let me see your{3}Chi now.{2}
Feizhi is gone! It is{3}dangerous outside the{3}village. I am worried.{2}
Feizhi is stronger than{3}she looks. She will{3}be okay.{2}
Warrior, show us your{3}Chi, like before.{2}
Warrior, that was great,{3}but Master Feh's Chi{3}is much stronger.{2}
Warrior, show me your{3}Chi. I want to see it{3}very badly.{2}
Feizhi, I know. I know{3}how you feel...{1}But it is not good{3}to ignore Master Feh.{2}
My kick and punch are{3}very loud! They cause{3}much pain when they hit.{2}
Show us your{3}Chi. Now. Do it now.{3}I want to see it.{2}
I am shocked that this{3}warrior can use Chi.{1}What will Master Feh say{3}when he sees it?{2}
Warrior, will you{3}show me your Chi?{30}
Very good. Now show me.{2}
What you can do{3}is an incredible thing.{3}Hiding it is not good.{2}
Feizhi is gone! It is{3}dangerous outside of{3}the village. I am worried.{2}
Feizhi is stronger than{3}she looks. She will be{3}all right.{2}
I know why you can{3}use Chi, warrior.{3}I know.{2}
Warrior, Chi is a great{3}power. Why hide it?{1}The master wants to see{3}your Chi very much.{2}
I want to see the Chi of{3}a warrior who knows{3}martial arts.{1}Why won't you show me,{3}warrior?{2}
Feizhi, I know how you{3}feel. But, it is not wise{3}to ignore Master Feh.{2}
My kick and punch are{3}very loud! They cause{3}much pain when they hit.{2}
Warrior, show me your{3}Chi. Now. Do it now.{3}I want to see it.{2}
Warrior, do not hide your{3}Chi from Master Feh.{3}It will make me a liar!{2}
Look! The tree fell.{2}
Master, did you see?{3}The warrior used Chi!{2}
Master, what is the{3}matter?{2}
He did not do it from{3}the line, so I{3}cannot be sure.{2}
That is not good.{3}Warrior, do it right!{3}Do it from the line.{2}
Warrior, use your Chi{3}from the line.{2}
Warrior, please!{3}Use your Chi from the{3}line.{2}
Warrior, the rules{3}require you to use{3}Chi from the line!{1}You cannot back down{3}now.{2}
So close! Warrior, use{3}Chi from the line.{3}Do it again.{2}
Ya! The tree fell!{2}
Master, did you see?{3}The warrior used Chi.{2}
The warrior's Chi is{3}excellent! Are you{3}surprised, Master?{2}
What is wrong, Master?{2}
Hmmmm... The warrior{3}did make the tree fall.{3}I grant you that...{2}
Is something wrong with{3}the warrior's Chi?{2}
What the warrior did...{3}It is not Chi.{2}
What? It is not Chi?{2}
Hmmm... It looks very{3}similar...but it is not{3}Chi.{2}
Warrior... Have you{5}{3}been to Fuchin Temple?{30}
Ah... I knew it.{2}
Hmmm... That is strange.{2}
How are Chi and{3}Fuchin Temple related?{2}
I learned my Chi{5}{3}from Master Hama{3}of Lama Temple.{2}
Then{5} it is the same{3}as Chi,{5} is it not?{2}
Very similar...{3}But still different...{2}
Chi concentrates the{3}energy of the body into{3}the hand...{1}then releases it onto{3}a distant object.{2}
You, warrior, used energy{3}focused from the mind.{3}Understand?{30}
This warrior is wise.{1}The power to will{3}something to move{3}requires much wisdom.{2}
Remember this...{1}Wishing for something{3}is the same as thinking{3}very hard.{2}
Fuchin's Ki releases the{3}mind's energy like Chi{3}releases the body's.{2}
The body's energy has{3}limits, but mental energy{5}{3}has few limits.{2}
Train your Ki. It{3}will grow very strong.{3}Do your best, warrior.{2}
Practice, everyone!{3}Chi has its limits,{3}but anyone can use it.{1}Practice, practice!{3}Until you learn the power{3}of Chi.{2}
Warrior, you are great.{3}You have earned{3}my respect.{2}
Everyone wants to learn{3}the Chi of Master Feh.{1}I will study kung fu{3}to learn Chi.{2}
Concentrate energy into{3}the hands{5} and release{3}it as Chi.{1}This is what Master Feh{3}teaches. But it is hard.{1}Master Hsu went to{3}Lama Temple. There, he{3}learns from Master Hama.{2}
Lama Temple is far west.{3}It is in Lamakan Desert.{1}Master Hsu went there{3}to train. He will come{3}back strong.{2}
I did not think much of{3}you, warrior. I apologize.{2}
Where did Feizhi go?{3}I am very worried.{2}
Master Hsu is late.{3}I can understand why{3}Feizhi worries.{2}
I will learn Chi. I will{3}become strong. Stronger{3}than Master Feh...{2}
Your Chi is Fuchin{3}Temple's. How is it{3}different from our Chi?{2}
I don't care which Chi{3}it is. Kung fu's{3}or Fuchin's...{1}I must learn it.{2}
Master Hama's Chi can{3}shatter boulders.{1}Can Master Hsu{3}shatter boulders with{3}his Chi?{2}
Follow Silk Road straight.{3}Pass through the canyon.{3}You will see Lama Temple.{2}
Warrior, you use weapons{3}and Chi. You are very{3}dangerous.{2}
Feizhi is not in the Feh{3}School anymore...{3}It is sad. Very lonely.{2}
Feizhi worries only about{3}Master Hsu. It makes{3}me a little jealous.{2}
Learning Chi...{3}is very hard.{3}Master Feh is amazing.{2}
Can such a young warrior{3}really do it? It is{3}hard to believe...{2}
You are a great warrior.{3}I must train, like you{3}must have trained.{2}
It is locked.{2}
Warriors cannot use...{3}Wait.{5} This is different{3}from Chi.{2}
Do not step over{3}the line, warrior.{2}
Stand beyond the line.{3}Then try your Chi.{2}
Do you think I am{3}following you, warrior?{30}
You are mistaken,{3}warrior. I just want{3}to go west.{1}You want to go west, too.{3}So, we end up going west{5}{3}together.{2}
You are right, warrior.{3}I am just going west,{5}{3}like you are going west.{2}
You're very persistent,{3}warrior. I just want to{3}go west.{1}So, we end up going west{5}{3}together.{2}
Yahh! Silk Road!{3}Boulders block the road!{2}
My vision...{3}It came true.{2}
Hsu, Hsu!{2}
It is no good. I{3}cannot hear{3}Hsu's voice!{2}
What do I do?{3}Warrior, should I return{3}to Xian?{30}
Going back is no option.{3}I must find Hsu.{2}
You are right, warrior.{3}Of course not.{3}I must find Hsu.{2}
Hsu is in danger.{3}I can sense it. I must{3}find him soon.{2}
Is this your first time{3}to visit Altin?{30}
Look at how much Altin{3}has changed!{1}You can't do much{3}here until the{3}waters subside.{2}
We must look a{3}lot like a coastal{3}town, huh?{30}
Nothing gets by you...{3}Altin never even had a{3}well in the old days.{1}Water-spewing{3}monsters are what{3}waterlogged the village.{2}
The day the gems fell{3}from the sky{5}, these{3}water-spewing monsters{1}appeared out of nowhere.{3}Now the village is ruined{3}because of them!{2}
How can those creatures{3}spit up so much water?{2}
How horrible! My house{3}is totally coated{3}in monster spit.{2}
Even the mine is{3}submerged. No one{3}can enter it.{2}
If we could just destroy{3}the monsters, all the{3}water should drain away.{2}
Altin always used to run{3}short on water. Now{3}we're all flooded in.{1}Either way, we just{3}have bad luck when{3}it comes to water.{2}
We can't drink the water{3}the monsters spew!{3}It's disgusting.{1}Won't anyone ever slay{3}those beasts?{2}
The waters around here{3}have subsided...{1}I wonder if the holes in{3}the mine allowed the{3}water to drain.{2}
The water beasts looked{3}exactly like Altin's{3}guardian statues...{1}Could the guardian{3}statues have turned{3}into the monsters?{2}
The waters have flushed{3}out tons of rock{3}from the mine.{1}Maybe now we'll find{3}gems and ore we've{3}never even seen before.{2}
You came to Altin at a{3}bad time. You're terribly{3}unlucky, huh?{2}
It's almost like they're{3}turning the air itself{3}into water!{2}
I'm glad I saved my very{3}first love letter, but what{3}about everything else?{2}
Even the toughest of{3}miners can't do much{3}in this water.{2}
If the water beasts{3}continue to flood us...{1}our entire village will{3}be submerged.{2}
Water is nice, but not{3}when it's flooding{3}your home.{2}
Ugh. The monsters spewed{3}out all of this water.{3}It smells foul...{2}
As the monsters go away,{3}the waters recede.{1}Maybe all of the{3}monsters will disappear{3}pretty soon...{2}
Come to think of it, it{3}looked like our guardian{3}statue was spewing water.{2}
It'll be better than{3}digging up more of those{3}durned ancient relics.{2}
Oh no... The whole{3}house is soaked...{2}
If the monster that did{3}this were here right now,{3}I'd give him such a smack!{1}I'm just{3}kidding... I'm opposed{3}to all this violence.{2}
It's going to take{3}a lot of work to get{3}this house back in shape.{2}
One blow's not enough.{3}Jab! Jab! Hook! Then{3}comes the uppercut!{2}
Are you trying to{3}find your way west{3}through the mountains?{30}
There should be a passage{3}that leads west at the{3}bottom of the mine.{2}
I don't know what you{3}did, but we are grateful{3}you defeated the beasts.{2}
Don't be too harsh{3}on those beasts.{2}
I thought the village was{3}done for. I'm glad we{3}didn't give up hope.{2}
I'm just glad to get{3}my house back.{2}
I didn't want to leave{3}my hometown...{3}That's why I came back.{2}
I heard someone killed{3}the water beasts.{3}That's why I came back.{1}There's no place{3}like home.{2}
You defeated those{3}monsters, didn't you?{30}
Here, let me thank{3}you with...a kiss!{1}Hey, you're turning{3}beet-red!{2}
Oh, you didn't? Still, I'm{3}happy to be back home,{3}so here's a kiss!{1}Hey, you're turning{3}beet-red!{2}
The bottom of the mine...{3}The end of the{3}easternmost passage...{1}I won't give that up.{2}
My husband's sense for{3}finding treasure has{3}never failed.{1}Once the water recedes,{3}we'll dig up that spot{3}he found.{2}
Mom and Pop know{3}something about the{3}bottom of the mine.{1}I wish they'd tell{3}me what it was.{2}
Do you want weapons?{30}
I'll sell you anything{3}you want once the waters{3}have receded.{1}What in the world{3}did we do to deserve{3}this fate?{2}
You wouldn't say that if{3}you saw my weapons. I{3}wish I could show you.{2}
Thank goodness the water{3}has receded. I can open{3}up shop again!{2}
Cripes... Is this how{3}my weapon shop ends?{3}As a sunken disaster?{2}
Only a merchant knows{3}the joy of being open to{3}do business again.{2}
My store is submerged...{3}I want to sell armor,{3}but there's no way.{2}
It's great that I can{3}sell armor out of my{3}shop again.{2}
All my armor inventory is{3}rusting even as we speak.{2}
We dried off all{3}that armor and{3}polished it up!{1}There should be no trace{3}of rust now.{2}
Oh, no! What will I do{3}if all my merchandise{3}is soaked?{2}
None of my goods were{3}damaged. I'm going to sell{3}like there's no tomorrow!{2}
If my goods are wet, I'll{3}have to dry them out{3}before I can sell them.{2}
A few things got damp...{1}But it shouldn't affect the{3}quality, so you can use{3}them without any worries.{1}...Maybe I'll put up a{3}sign to explain it all.{2}
We got a little damp, but{3}we're doing okay. We {3}must count our blessings.{30}
After all, a lot of{3}good people have been{3}hurt in this flooding.{2}
You have to remember,{3}lots of people lost{3}everything they own.{1}It's just sad, when{3}you think about it.{2}
I'd give anything for{3}someone to return{3}Altin to its former glory.{1}You look pretty young,{3}but if you are a true{3}warrior, please help us.{2}
I came from Xian.{3}I cook good food.{3}Eat up!{2}
None of us can go{3}home until the{3}water subsides.{2}
The guests in Room One{3}moved back home when{3}the waters receded.{2}
The guests in Room Two{3}also went home after the{3}waters receded.{2}
We'll come through this{3}all right, but I'm afraid{3}the village is done for.{2}
I know they don't look{3}so tough, but being{3}warriors and all,{1}maybe they can help us.{2}
I became a cook after{3}I came to Altin, but I still{3}cook well.{2}
Most of the village is{3}still submerged...{1}It will be a long time{3}before Altin returns{3}to its former glory.{2}
It looks like the water{3}has receded a bit,{1}but it will be a long{3}time before Altin returns{3}to its former glory.{2}
No matter what happens,{3}I'd never abandon Altin.{2}
Of course, our house will{3}be ruined now.{1}I wish I could{3}move away...{2}
Leaving Altin for Tolbi?{3}Well, that's just crazy.{2}
Now I finally have an{3}excuse to move to{3}my favorite town{24}Tolbi!{2}
Not many people come up{3}Silk Road to Altin. You're{3}an odd one, you are.{2}
It's been a long time{3}since I got a break{3}from doing housework.{2}
Of course, you can't{3}go west of the mountains{3}without taking Silk Road.{2}
I hate sitting around{3}like this. I want to{3}go home!{2}
It was after that eerie{3}night when the gems{3}fell from the sky.{1}That was when the{3}water-spewing beasts{3}appeared in the mine!{2}
Please save the helpless{3}in Altin...{2}
We did it, {17}{1}!{3}We beat the last{3}water beast!{2}
I wonder why Altin's{3}guardian statues turned{3}into monsters.{1}Isn't it strange?{30}
And what's up with this{3}strange, tiled room at the{3}bottom of the mine?{2}
Oh, I'm sure you get{3}that sort of thing{3}all the time.{1}Still, it's strange that the{3}bottom of the mine was{3}made of carved stone.{2}
The guardian statues{3}were created long,{3}long ago.{2}
What are they for?{2}
There's a treasure{3}chest behind the{3}guardian statue!{2}
It must all be related{3}to these ruins, buried{3}deep in the mine...{2}
I guess so... Hey, {17}{1},{3}we should check that{3}chest before we go!{2}
In the hands of an Adept,{3}the Lifting Gem imparts{3}great power.{2}
{17}{1} acquired{3}the Psynergy Lift.{2}
Thank you so much for{3}defeating the hydros{3}statues in the mine.{2}
Did you see water{3}gushing out when you slew{3}those hydros creatures?{30}
I see... So the water{3}monsters are like{3}giant water tanks...{2}
Really... Then how could{3}they have carried all{3}that water?{2}
Once the mine opens{3}again, we'll be able to{3}get back on our feet.{2}
They already started{3}mining the upper parts{3}of the mountain.{1}But people still seem{3}afraid to go down to{3}the lower depths.{2}
The water drained out of{3}the mine through all the{3}cracks, as I expected.{1}But the remaining water{3}will probably sit here{3}for a while.{2}
Thank goodness,{3}the village is free{3}from all that water.{2}
Are you the ones who{3}defeated the water{3}beasts?{30}
We'd be much obliged{3}if you'd also help{3}rebuild the village.{2}
I heard our rescuers{3}were young. I'd like{3}to meet them.{2}
The village went right{3}back to normal once{3}the water monsters left.{1}But it's still a mess{3}around here.{2}
So those hydros creatures{3}really were the guardian{3}statues, huh?{1}That sure is a surprise.{2}
Is it true you found{3}ancient ruins in the{3}deepest part of the mine?{30}
Really? I always thought{3}that mine held some{3}kind of secret.{2}
Hmmm, are you sure you{3}even went down there?{1}Someone ought to{3}go check it out.{2}
We can go back to{3}work in the{3}mines again.{2}
I was afraid more water{3}would gush out when{3}the monsters were slain.{2}
I hope Altin Mine will{3}thrive again soon,{3}like it once did.{2}
The water seeped into{3}the mine shafts.{1}I bet the rock is{3}very soft.{2}
It's so humid inside that{3}cave. It feels awful{3}and sticky in there!{2}
That strange chamber in{3}the mines creeps me out.{2}
You fought pretty well{3}despite all that foul water{3}the beasts spewed out.{2}
That mine is full of holes{3}and chasms. That's why{3}it drained so well.{2}
The old guardian statues{3}always creeped me out.{3}I'm glad they're gone.{2}
I used to find all sorts{3}of artifacts. I wonder if{3}they came from the ruins.{2}
I hear that Silk{3}Road is closed...{1}Or, at least, that's what{3}this girl from Xian said.{2}
A girl from Xian was{3}asking questions about{3}young warriors.{1}Say, could she have{3}meant you guys?{30}
She was searching{3}very hard.{2}
Well, if not, I hope she{3}finds whoever she was{3}looking for.{2}
The merchants must be{3}having a hard time if{3}Silk Road is blocked.{1}Who could clear{3}away a landslide?{2}
I wonder what business{3}that girl from Xian has{3}with warriors...{2}
Ancient ruins and{3}treasure definitely go{3}together...{1}What are you going{3}to do?{2}
If only they had left a{3}water monster or two...{2}
They say you can still{3}find monsters if you go{3}deep enough in the mine.{1}I'd go treasure hunting{3}if it weren't for those{3}nasty beasts.{2}
How can I truly be{3}happy if all those cute{3}monsters are gone?{2}
Really? Ancient ruins at{3}the bottom of the{3}mine? You don't say...{2}
There probably isn't{3}much treasure in the{3}ruins beneath the mine.{1}Why don't you forget{3}about treasure and just{3}resume your journey?{2}
Something's wrong with{3}Mom and Pop. They've{3}been acting weird{1}ever since the ruins were{3}found in the mine.{2}
Cripes. Ancient ruins{3}down in the mine...{1}We have to go get that{3}treasure right away.{2}
I had no idea there were{3}ruins beneath the mine.{2}
I wonder if Mom and Pop{3}knew about the monument{3}in the mine.{2}
You'll have to find the{3}passage in the mine{3}that leads west{1}if Silk Road is blocked.{2}
I've heard of a passage{3}in the mine that leads{3}west, but I've yet to meet{1}anyone who's found it.{2}
How about it? Aren't you{3}impressed by our vast{3}armor selection?{2}
Well, if you are{3}impressed, then make{3}a purchase!{2}
The girl from Xian bought{3}a lot. I wonder if{3}she is on a journey.{2}
The girl from Xian bought{3}all goods that had{3}been submerged.{2}
There is a small temple{3}to the west of Altin Mine.{1}They may be having{3}trouble with the water{3}from the mine.{2}
There is an endless{3}desert west of{3}the mountains.{1}Any travelers going{3}west must prepare{3}themselves well.{2}
West of the mountains{3}is very{24}very hot!{3}It is exhausting!{1}Eating hot food is{3}good. It helps you{3}endure the heat.{2}
There are a few beasts in{3}the mine still, but they're{3}down deep below, right?{30}
Good. Then we can just{3}mine the upper{3}passages.{2}
If they're in the upper{3}passages, then we can't{3}mine like we used to.{2}
I think that temple was{3}called Lama Temple.{1}There are said to be{3}people with strange{3}powers there.{2}
You won't be able to go{3}to the desert for a while{3}since Silk Road is blocked.{2}
No one can go west of{3}the mountains now.{2}
It will take some time{3}before Altin recovers{3}from this.{2}
You saved Altin from{3}the monsters.{1}Clearly this is the{3}work of the hand of Fate.{2}
Almighty Fate must{3}have heard me.{2}
Watch for falling rocks!{1}Do not strike the{3}wall! Rocks may fall!{2}
Tch!{5} We came this deep{3}into the mine just to{3}find a dead end!{2}
...I have a bad feeling{3}about this. Run,{3}{17}{1}! Now!{2}
He who has the power to see{3}that which cannot be seen{3}shall see the truth...{1}So reads the writing{3}on the wall.{2}
This is Lama Temple.{3}Welcome, travelers.{1}The Lamakan Desert ahead{3}is a very hot land. Rest{3}well before you go.{2}
Young warriors, do you{3}come from the east?{30}
Then you must have come{3}across Lamakan Desert...{2}
Did you stop in Xian{3}along the way?{30}
Master Feh, in Xian, is{3}very close to our{3}Master Hama.{1}Students from Feh's{3}school often continue their{3}kung fu training here...{2}
Then it is good that{3}you have come here.{1}Feh's kung fu is good{3}for warriors who{3}seek to better themselves.{2}
Do you know what{3}meditation is?{30}
It allows you to find{3}peace by closing{3}your eyes...{1}and sealing your{3}mind from the{3}world around you.{2}
It is training in which{3}you clear your mind of{3}all thought...{1}and try to become{3}as still and calm{3}as a stone.{2}
You who speak to me...{3}I sense great insecurity{3}and anxiety within you.{2}
Did you know that Master{3}Hama is the greatest{3}master of Chi?{30}
You do? Then you must{3}have already met Master{3}Feh in Xian, haven't you?{1}But Hama's power does{3}not end there.{2}
Then today, you shall{3}see that Master Hama is{3}truly the master of Chi.{2}
They seem to be anxious.{3}They cannot survive{3}the desert like that.{2}
They say a person can{3}overcome any trial{3}once he masters kung fu.{2}
.{5}.{5}.{5}.{5}.{5}.{5}{3}.{5}.{5}.{5}.{5}.{5}.{5}{3}I{5}{5}{5} am hungry...{2}
I sense impure thoughts{3}from the man beside me...{3}His training is weak.{2}
Chi is but a fragment of{3}Master Hama's power...{3}She is a true scholar.{2}
Master Hama is{3}meditating. Please be{3}extremely quiet.{2}
So, {17}{1}, you and{3}your Adept companions{3}have finally come.{2}
Finally come?{3}Was she expecting us?{30}
But how did she know{3}we'd be here now?{2}
Then, how come she knew{3}we were coming, {17}{1}?{3}{2}
I had{5} anticipated{5}{3}your arrival.{2}
You knew we were{3}coming, then?{2}
I have been waiting a{3}long while for you.{1}You come seeking{3}the Elemental Stars.{2}
You know about the{3}Elemental Stars, too?{3}Who...{5} Who are you?{2}
I am a Jupiter Adept,{3}just like {17}{3}.{2}
I'm not a Jupiter Adept!{3}What are you{3}talking about?{2}
You are, {17}{3}, although{3}you may not yet know it.{2}
Why do you say that?{2}
Do you not have the{3}power to read minds?{2}
This ability is unique{3}to the Jupiter Adepts.{2}
You predicted our{3}coming... Is that{3}also{5} Psynergy?{2}
Ho ho!{5} Excellent question,{3}Miss {17}{4}.{2}
Yes, the ability to foresee{3}events also belongs to{3}the Jupiter Adepts.{2}
Then, can {17}{3} learn the{3}power of prediction, too?{2}
He already has.{2}
I don't think I have{24}{2}
You do.{5} You merely do{3}not yet know that{3}you have it.{2}
The power of Jupiter{3}must be great if it{3}lets you see the future.{2}
Oh, but {17}{3} can learn{3}to use an even{3}greater power!{2}
What greater power?{2}
Reveal.{2}
Reveal?{2}
Yes. I have waited long{3}to pass the power of{3}true sight on to you.{2}
You waited here in Lama{3}Temple just to teach{3}Reveal to {17}{3}?{2}
You will need Reveal{3}if you are to achieve{3}your goals...{2}
Jupiter Adepts can learn{3}Reveal on their own,{3}over time...{2}
But that power alone will{3}not help you find Saturos{3}as his company moves on.{2}
It was Saturos and his{3}companions who blocked{3}Silk Road.{2}
{17}{5} and the rest{3}of them, huh?{5}{3}Those cowards!{2}
{17}{5} bears a terrible{3}fate, a burden I would{3}not wish on any man.{2}
A terrible fate?{3}What do you mean?{2}
I am sorry, but I can{3}say nothing more of{3}this matter.{2}
Now, we must focus on{3}the power of Reveal.{2}
You will need the power{3}of Reveal to cross the{3}evil Lamakan Desert.{2}
An evil desert?{3}Is that even possible?{30}
You believe that, {17}{1}?{3}Well, I just don't buy it.{2}
It's hard to believe,{3}isn't it, {17}{1}?{3}I feel the same way.{2}
Why will we need Reveal{3}to cross the desert?{2}
Crossing Lamakan Desert{3}was hard enough with{3}the extreme heat.{2}
But evil has taken hold of{3}the desert, and its heat{3}has become unbearable.{2}
Entering the desert now{3}is nothing short of{3}asking for death.{2}
Then how can Saturos{3}cross such a deadly{3}place?{2}
Saturos and Menardi{3}are Mars Adepts.{2}
I am merely guessing...{1}but their powers might{3}help them suppress the{3}heat as they cross.{2}
I still don't understand...{3}How will Reveal help us{3}in such an evil place?{2}
Reveal will help you{3}find oases to cool you{3}against the heat.{2}
Why would we need{3}Reveal for that? Won't we{3}be able to see the oases?{2}
Do you know what{3}a mirage is?{30}
The desert is filled with{3}mirages that prevent you{3}from seeing clearly.{1}Without Reveal, you{3}cannot find the oases.{2}
Intense heat creates{3}a curtain of air that{3}distorts the terrain.{1}Mirages will deceive your{3}eyes, preventing you from{3}finding any oases.{2}
Sounds like we should{3}have {17}{3} learn Reveal,{3}don't you think?{30}
Yeah! I don't want to{3}die in any{3}evil desert!{2}
Oh, come on, {17}{1}!{3}If we're going to follow{3}{17}{5}, we'll need Reveal!{2}
{17}{3}, you should let{3}Master Hama teach you{3}how to use Reveal.{2}
What's wrong,{3}Master Hama?{1}You{5} can pass Reveal on{3}to me,{5} can't you?{2}
I am{5} unsure that{3}it will work.{2}
In preparation for{3}this day, I tried to{3}pass a power on{1}to a young girl,{3}although that power{3}was not Reveal.{2}
My student was{3}not an Adept...{2}
But I thought anyone could{3}hone a skill he or she{3}already possessed...{2}
However, I saw no{3}change in the girl.{2}
No! There was change!{2}
Feizhi... Why are{3}you here?{2}
I sensed it!{2}
Sensed it? What did{3}you sense?{2}
Hsu is in great danger!{2}
Hsu left this place{3}a long time ago.{2}
I know...{3}But Hsu did not{3}return to Xian.{2}
...The boulders in the{3}mountains!{2}
I sensed it. I came{3}through the mine.{3}I came to ask for help.{2}
I sensed nothing, as I{3}was focused on {17}{1}'s{3}arrival...{2}
But{5} why has the power{3}come to you now, after{3}all this time?{2}
Gems fell from the sky.{3}One hit me right{3}on the head.{2}
Gems...{2}
Psynergy Stones...{2}
Then{5} this may work{3}after all.{2}
What about Hsu?{2}
Let us hurry to{3}Hsu's aid!{2}
Master Hama, what about{3}us? What about Reveal?{2}
I had completely forgotten.{2}
It seems I succeeded in{3}passing my power to{3}Feizhi. You will be fine.{2}
This should do it.{3}Use Reveal to cross{3}the desert.{2}
But your Reveal may not{3}be that strong yet...{3}The oases may not appear.{2}
The rest is up to{3}{17}{3}'s abilities.{2}
{17}{3}, I am very glad{3}to see you have grown to{3}be such a strong man.{2}
{17}{3}, do you and{3}Master Hama...{3}know each other?{2}
No... But she doesn't{3}feel like{5} a stranger...{2}
{17}{5} and the others{3}must be far ahead of{3}us by now...{30}
Then we'd better get{3}moving! Let's go!{2}
The desert may have{3}slowed them down, but{3}we can't waste a second!{2}
We can't just{3}leave like this!{2}
Hama might need{3}our help...{2}
She only has Feizhi{3}to assist her.{3}Shouldn't we help, too?{30}
I'm more worried about{3}{17}{5} and the others...{1}But I'm not opposed{3}to rescuing Hsu.{2}
I am worried about Feizhi{3}and Master Hama...{1}But I understand why{3}you want to chase{3}after {17}{5}.{2}
We'll go with you, {17}{1},{3}whatever you decide!{2}
I wonder what Master{3}Hama was talking about...{2}
Oh, I'm sorry...{3}Let's go.{2}
Hsu, are you okay?{2}
Master Hama, I am okay.{3}But the boulder...{3}I cannot move.{2}
Hsu seems unhurt.{3}You must be glad, Feizhi.{2}
Yes. Thank you, Master.{3}But how can we free him?{2}
I{5} don't know{3}what we can do.{2}
Well, {17}{1}! Adepts!{3}You came to help...{1}Hsu is in trouble,{3}as you can see.{3}What should we do?{2}
Be strong, Hsu!{3}We will help you!{2}
I am trapped between{3}these two boulders.{1}At least I wasn't{3}crushed. I was lucky.{2}
How should we move{3}the boulders?{2}
Hsu tires. He looks{3}exhausted.{3}I am worried!{2}
I want to scream.{3}But Feizhi does not{3}like it when I do that.{2}
{17}{1}, did you lift{3}the boulder?{2}
Oh my! The boulder!{3}It floats!{2}
Quickly, Feizhi. We must{3}pull Hsu free!{2}
Ready yourself, Hsu.{3}I am going to pull.{3}One, two, three!{2}
He is halfway out.{3}Just a little further.{2}
Can you hang on just{3}a moment longer, {17}{1}?{30}
Thank you, {17}{1}!{2}
You cannot back out now!{3}You must be responsible!{2}
Ready? I am going to pull!{3}One, two, three!{2}
We did it! Master Hama,{3}Hsu is free!{2}
We did it, Feizhi!{2}
Thank you, {17}{1}!{2}
We must contact Master{3}Feh and ask him to tend{3}to Hsu's injuries.{2}
I will ask him to clean{3}up the rocks, too.{2}
Excellent. If Silk Road{3}remains blocked,{3}everyone will suffer.{2}
Adepts, let me thank you{3}again. I am{3}truly grateful.{2}
I did not expect you{3}to come and aid us.{2}
No, Master Hama...{3}We are the ones who{3}should be grateful.{2}
Thank you for passing{3}the power of Reveal on{3}to me...{1}But{5} what you said...{2}
What is it, {17}{3}?{2}
Well, really, I was the{3}one who suggested we{3}help you,{5} right?{30}
What? Didn't you want{3}us to hurry on to the{3}desert, {17}{2}?{2}
Did I, {17}{4}? Did I really?{3}I think you must be{5}{3}mistaken. Yeah, that's it!{2}
No, {17}{2}...{3}You wanted us{3}to get moving!{2}
{17}{1}, {17}{4}...{3}Don't make me look{3}like a fool...{2}
Do not worry, {17}{2}.{3}I do not mind.{2}
Travel well, my friends.{2}
I hope to see{3}you soon.{2}
Weren't you going to ask{3}Master Hama what she{3}meant earlier?{2}
We do not know when we{3}will be able to see{3}Master Hama again.{2}
{17}{1}, don't you think{3}we should ask Master{3}Hama what she meant?{30}
See? If it's bothering{3}you, you should just go{3}ahead and ask now!{2}
Huh? You think we should{3}just leave it as is?{2}
Thank you, everyone...{2}
but it is better{3}that we leave now.{2}
What do you mean?{2}
Master Hama hasn't{3}looked me in the eye since{3}she said those words.{2}
Well, that just makes{3}me even more curious!{2}
Don't worry about it.{3}I doubt she would even{3}tell me if I asked.{2}
Well, that's just...{2}
Master Hama will{3}tell me when we have{3}completed our mission.{2}
I have to believe that...{2}
It is very dangerous to{3}cross Lamakan Desert.{3}Be very careful!{2}
The evil desert is hotter{3}than the sun itself.{3}Look for oases!{2}
I believe it is possible{3}to learn the power of{3}prediction by meditating.{2}
I will be most thankful{3}once the evil desert{3}returns to normal.{2}
When your temperature{3}reaches its maximum,{1}you will take{3}tremendous damage.{1}Go quickly, and find{3}yourselves an oasis{3}when you get too hot.{2}
Master Hama is{3}meditating, asking for{3}your safety.{2}
The future holds many{3}hardships, but you must{3}not give up the fight.{2}
I cannot cross the{3}desert. It is too{3}fearsome for me.{2}
The evil in the desert{3}distorts all{24}even light.{3}What could be the cause?{2}
How nice it would be{3}if I could see the{3}future.{2}
Master Hama will be very{3}sad if you are lost{3}in the desert.{2}
With Reveal, you will find{3}oases with your mind,{3}not with your eyes.{2}
I do not think Master{3}Hama wants {17}{3} to go...{2}
I cannot see your{3}future clearly...{1}It must be because{3}I cannot be impartial{3}to it...or to you.{2}
North: Altin Mine{3}West: Lama Temple{2}
Agh...{5} This desert is much{3}hotter than I ever{3}imagined...{2}
Just walking around{3}here saps every{3}ounce of my strength.{2}
I can't stop sweating...{5}{3}I wish I'd brought{3}a change of clothes...{2}
I'm so thirsty...{5} Water!{5}{3}I need some water!{2}
I can't keep my cool{3}when it's this hot...{2}
Ew... My clothes are{3}drenched in sweat!{3}This is gross!{2}
Aghh!{5} I can't stand it!{5}{3}My feet are burning!{2}
I can't stand another{3}minute of this!{3}Where's an oasis?{2}
If we don't find an{3}oasis soon, I'm gonna{3}shrivel up and blow away!{2}
I'm traveling around{3}the world to spread{3}good will.{2}
Since I'm here, I'd like{3}to learn the secrets{3}of Fuchin Temple,{1}but that won't happen{3}unless I undergo{3}intense training.{2}
I am traveling around{3}the world to spread{3}good will.{2}
For some reason, these{3}people give me the{3}same feeling I got{1}from the master of{3}the temple, Master Hama.{1}Yes... I feel as though{3}my mind is being{3}read somehow...{2}
We moved the rocks.{3}Now people can pass.{2}
Many people from Xian{3}helped move the rocks.{3}They were very heavy!{2}
We cleared the way.{3}But what about these{3}rocks? Must we{1}clear these?{2}
I almost hurt my back.{3}It is because I have{3}not been training.{2}
Xian is a peaceful{3}village, but we have had{3}trouble lately.{1}Hsu is Master Feh's{3}apprentice. He was{3}trapped under a boulder.{2}
There was a rockslide on{3}Silk Road. It had{3}us all in shock.{2}
I went to help move{3}boulders...{3}Now, my back hurts.{2}
The people who cleared{3}the rockslide told me{3}Lamakan Desert is red.{1}Why is it red?{2}
Hsu is very good at{3}kung fu, but boulders are{3}very hard.{1}Kung fu is no good{3}against boulders.{2}
The people of Xian love{3}their village. They almost{3}never leave it.{1}But everyone left town{3}to help clear the rocks{3}off Silk Road.{2}
Altin was flooded with{3}water, but young warriors{3}fixed it. Feizhi said so.{2}
We cleared the rocks{3}from Silk Road. It was{3}very hard work.{2}
Many strange things{3}happened all at once.{3}What is going on?{2}
Hsu was caught under{3}a boulder, but he only{3}broke one leg.{2}
The rocks there were{3}very hard. Why did they{3}fall? It seems strange.{2}
Some people did not carry{3}rocks. I thought we{3}would cooperate.{1}I was foolish.{2}
Sand is the color of{3}the camel. Red sand{3}is very strange.{2}
Hsu is strong-headed.{3}He would not run from{3}falling boulders.{1}That is what happened.{2}
Everyone stays in Xian.{3}They do not know about{3}the outside world.{2}
This warrior saved Altin{3}village, no?{2}
It is bad for Xian if{3}rocks stay there.{1}Caravans cannot pass.{3}Silk merchants cannot{3}come to Xian.{2}
I was happy to see{3}gems falling from the sky,{3}but it was very strange.{1}I could sense bad{3}things coming.{2}
Where are the merchants?{3}No one comes. I hope{3}they come buy silk.{2}
Merchants bring us coins.{3}They must bring{3}them soon.{1}We need them to buy{3}food for winter.{2}
Why does Master Hammet{3}not come? We need him.{2}
Merchants sell silk. It is{3}like a carnival. It{3}will be sad to miss it.{2}
Is something wrong on{3}Silk Road? In Lamakan{3}Desert, too?{30}
That is terrible. No one{3}can use Silk Road!{2}
The desert is fine?{3}That is good to hear.{2}
None can pass through{3}Lamakan. This is very,{3}very sad.{2}
Feizhi said the desert{3}became evil.{2}
The desert was very hot.{3}Now it is hotter...{3}No one can survive it.{2}
Did the monsters in{3}Altin spit water?{30}
The town was flooded by{3}monsters? That takes{3}much water. How strange!{2}
It is not true?{3}But why would Feizhi lie?{2}
The mine in Altin filled{3}with water. I wanted{3}to see it.{2}
The village is flooded?{3}Because of monsters?{1}I am very confused...{2}
Water monsters... How{3}terrible for Altin.{1}But Xian has Master Feh.{3}He will defeat them.{2}
Hsu's injury taught a{3}good lesson.{1}Even kung fu is no{3}good against boulders.{2}
Hsu was pummeled by{3}huge boulders. His{3}injuries are not serious.{1}Kung fu helped him.{2}
Kung fu makes you quick,{3}does it not?{1}Even so, Hsu could not{3}outrun the falling rocks.{2}
We should sell armor{3}to kung fu masters,{3}as well.{2}
Do you plan to cross{3}the desert, warrior?{30}
It will take much{3}strength. Perhaps you{3}should buy many supplies.{2}
You are wise, warrior.{3}The wise man knows to{3}avoid danger.{2}
You lose strength in heat.{3}Use my goods to recover{3}your strength.{2}
We have few customers{3}these days.{1}Customers can't come{3}if Silk Road is{3}completely blocked.{2}
When Lamakan Desert{3}burns, it is bad{3}for Xian.{1}Xian cannot sell silk.{3}The villagers cannot{3}survive winter.{2}
Hot food is good for{3}crossing Lamakan Desert.{1}Hot food brings back{3}your appetite.{2}
Caravans cannot bring{3}merchants here when{3}boulders block the road.{2}
The merchants do not{3}come, because the Lamakan{3}Desert burns.{1}It is bad for business.{2}
Eat, warrior. I will add{3}many hot peppers and{3}savory spices.{2}
Mogall Prairie is now a{3}forest, and Lamakan is{3}an evil desert.{1}We cannot go anywhere{3}from here now.{2}
If I cannot go east or{3}west, I will have to stay{3}in Xian until I die.{2}
This is Master Feh's{3}kung fu school.{1}Studying martial arts{3}keeps Xian peaceful.{2}
Boulders overcame Hsu.{3}Kung fu should never{3}be overcome.{1}We have to practice more.{2}
Water monsters flooded{3}Altin. Did you defeat{3}them, warrior?{30}
You are much stronger{3}than you look, warrior.{1}I have much respect{3}for you now.{2}
Oh... You are not the{3}strong warrior Feizhi{3}spoke of?{2}
Hsu did not practice{3}jumping enough.{1}He could have dodged{3}boulders by jumping.{2}
Feizhi predicted Hsu's{3}danger. Her prophecy{3}came true...{1}That saved Hsu. Now{3}he has returned.{3}It is quite odd.{2}
Hsu is resting. Feizhi{3}is watching over him. They{3}will be glad to see you.{2}
Peace has returned to{3}Xian, but danger still{3}lurks both east and west.{2}
No matter how much you{3}practice your kicks,{1}your feet will never{3}be harder than a boulder.{2}
The monsters are very{3}large. Striking one would{3}hurt your hand.{1}Should we train with{3}weapons, perhaps?{2}
When a boulder falls,{3}jump. Repeat as needed.{3}That is all it takes.{2}
Where did Feizhi gain the{3}power to foresee trouble?{3}I want it, too.{2}
Master Feh is very{3}worried about{3}those two.{2}
Oh, warrior! Welcome!{2}
Hsu was saved, thanks{3}to you and Master Hama.{1}You have my deepest{3}gratitude.{2}
I was injured by rocks{3}on my way from{3}Lama Temple.{1}I am sad my training{3}could not help me.{2}
Feizhi's prediction{3}came true.{1}Now, I believe she{3}can foresee things.{2}
Master Hama has great{3}power. You do, too,{3}young warrior.{1}You are both amazing.{2}
I knew help would come{3}when I was trapped.{3}I must thank everyone.{2}
Feizhi's ability to sense{3}trouble is real. I am{3}quite surprised.{2}
Hsu was trapped under{3}the rocks, but he was{3}all right.{1}We have Master Hama to{3}thank for that.{2}
I was injured by boulders{3}on my way from{3}Lama Temple.{1}I am sad my training{3}could not help me.{2}
Feizhi's prediction{3}came true.{1}Now, I believe she{3}can foresee things.{2}
Master Hama has great{3}power. Some was passed{3}on to me.{1}I am quite happy.{2}
I knew help would come{3}when I was trapped.{3}I must thank everyone.{2}
Feizhi's ability to foresee{3}is real. I am{3}quite surprised.{2}
Welcome to Kalay! You{3}may enter, so long as you{3}do not disrupt the peace.{2}
We soldiers protect{3}the peace in Kalay with{3}our lives.{2}
Lord Hammet, the{3}founder of Kalay, is a{3}great merchant.{2}
Lord Hammet is still out{3}with his caravans{3}on business.{1}I wonder where he{3}could be now.{2}
The bridge to the north{3}was destroyed by lava.{1}Thankfully, it has been{3}rebuilt since then.{2}
I heard a rumor that{3}there's trouble in{3}Lamakan Desert.{2}
Kalay sits at a great{3}crossroads. Xian lies{3}east, and Tolbi west.{1}This is the perfect{3}place to do business.{2}
The guests at the inn{3}are tourists on their{3}way to see Colosso.{1}It seems like a lot of{3}hassle to travel to Tolbi{3}just for a carnival.{2}
I hear Colosso is{3}incredible. I'd love to see{3}such a huge carnival.{2}
A huge mountain north{3}of the river erupted{3}violently.{1}I think it was{3}called Mt. Aleph.{2}
Lord Hammet's knack for{3}business is the reason{3}Kalay has flourished.{2}
I came to Kalay because{3}I didn't like Tolbi...{3}You want to know why?{30}
Because Babi, the ruler{3}of Tolbi, frightens me.{1}He has ruled Tolbi for{3}more than a hundred{3}years, they say.{2}
Kalay is a much better{3}town than Tolbi.{3}I won't go back.{2}
I can't put the rumors{3}about Lord Hammet being{3}captured by thieves{1}out of my head... But the{3}lord's wife, Layana,{3}speaks little of it.{2}
People say Lord Hammet{3}went north from Vault{3}after Mt. Aleph erupted.{1}No one knows what{3}happened to him or his{3}caravan after that.{2}
Hmm... This young warrior{3}has honest eyes and a{3}good demeanor.{1}A man like that is{3}never evil.{2}
Our job requires us to{3}judge whether to allow{3}a visitor into Kalay.{2}
Lord Hammet's love for{3}liberty and peace gave{3}birth to this town.{2}
Despite his appearance,{3}Lord Hammet can be{3}very rash.{1}That's why I'm worried.{2}
Lord Hammet's soldiers{3}went to Vault after{3}the bridge was rebuilt.{1}The palace has been{3}very quiet ever since...{2}
Strange things have been{3}happening all across the{3}land lately...{1}What is the{3}world coming to?{2}
Hammet chose to build{3}Kalay here because it's in{3}a prime trading location.{1}Lord Hammet truly is{3}a smart man.{2}
Actually... I wish I{3}were going to Colosso.{1}I should have saved{3}my money. Then I'd be{3}on that tour, too.{2}
Maybe when I'm older,{3}I'll even get to go{3}fight in Colosso!{2}
During the volcano's{3}eruption, odd gems and{3}rocks fell from the sky.{2}
Lord Hammet is a very{3}honest man, who values{3}trust above all.{1}That's probably why{3}he's so respected.{2}
The difference between{3}Kalay and Tolbi{3}is their leaders.{1}Lord Hammet rules with{3}trust, while Lord Babi{3}rules with force.{2}
I had no idea that Lunpa{3}was just north of Vault.{1}It's funny that a city{3}of merchants would be so{3}close to a city of thieves.{2}
There are so many{3}rumors now, no one knows{3}what the truth is.{2}
You can live in peace in{3}Kalay, as long as you{3}practice good will.{2}
I came here to spread{3}good will...{1}But Lord Hammet seems{3}to be the source of all{3}their good will.{1}This is not good...{2}
OK!{5} Are we all{3}listening? Let's stop{3}right here.{2}
Why are we stopping{3}at a place like this?{2}
Yeah!{5} We have to hurry,{3}or we'll be late{3}for Colosso!{2}
Late for Colosso?{3}We can't have that!{2}
That won't do at all!{2}
We paid good money to{3}see Colosso!{3}We can't be late!{2}
Everything will be just{3}fine, folks!{2}
We're just checking{3}to make sure no one{3}is missing!{2}
Well, I guess that's OK...{2}
But if anyone is{3}missing, we're the one's{3}who'll miss out.{2}
Forget about them!{3}Let's just get a move on!{2}
Oh, dear...{2}
All right, hurry up{3}and start counting!{2}
Uh-oh... We're short one{3}person... Now where{3}could he be?{2}
What's going on?{3}Why aren't we leaving{3}for Tolbi yet?{2}
There are a lot of{3}people waiting to see{3}Colosso, here!{2}
Hey? What's up? Why are{3}the guides pacing{3}back and forth?{2}
We have to decide if{3}we're entering Colosso{3}once we reach Tolbi.{2}
I hear there was a{3}landslide on the road{3}to Tolbi.{1}We paid good money to{3}take this cruise to{3}see Colosso!{2}
Come on! Why aren't{3}we leaving yet?{2}
Right when we're leaving,{3}they tell us we have{3}to ride a boat?{1}I can't stand boats...{5}{3}If I had known,{3}I never would have come.{2}
It's just a shame a{3}man like you can't ride{3}on a boat, Ouranos.{2}
That's odd. No matter{3}how many times I count,{3}we're still one short.{2}
I counted everyone at{3}the inn... So where{3}did we lose him?{2}
Who's missing? Come on,{3}we're all waiting!{2}
There are a lot of{3}people taking the tour{3}to Tolbi this year.{2}
Can't we just forget{3}about that missing guy{3}and get moving!?{2}
With so many going to{3}Tolbi, I'm sure a few of{3}them are entering Colosso.{2}
I'm a little worried, with{3}all these strange things{3}happening everywhere!{2}
This an embarassment!{3}Waiting around after{3}announcing we're leaving!{2}
I'm embarrassed to say{3}this, but I can't swim.{1}What am I going to do{3}if the boat capsizes...{2}
That's why I've been{3}telling you I'd teach{3}you how to swim...{2}
Maybe I should go check{3}and see if he's still at{3}the inn. What should I do?{2}
That's it... {5}We can't{3}wait any longer!{2}
Can't wait? What do{3}you mean?{2}
We all knew that anyone{3}who was late would be{3}left behind, right?{2}
Everyone understood that.{2}
Then what's the problem?{5}{3}We'll miss the boat if{3}we wait any longer!{2}
Miss the boat?{5}{3}We can't let that happen!{2}
We paid a lot of money...{1}We have to arrive{3}before the{3}carnival starts!{2}
There's nothing we can{3}do...{5}{5} Let's go!{2}
Yeah! Let's go!{2}
OK...{5} Follow me, and{3}stay in line!{2}
Hmm... {5}Now where did my{3}tour group get to...?{2}
No! They wouldn't have{3}left without me{5}{5},{3}would they?{2}
Oh, no! I'd better{3}get moving!{2}
I'm shocked to hear the{3}righteous thieves of{3}Lunpa have gone bad.{1}They say Lunpa's grandson{3}is responsible for it.{2}
Lunpa was a kind thief.{3}His son is Donpa{24}he's{3}an honorable thief, too.{1}He stole, but he was{3}just. Lunpa's grandson,{3}Dodonpa, is another story.{1}He doesn't even{3}think twice about{3}doing evil...{2}
The region north of Vault{3}was once a safe place...{1}but nowadays it is{3}very dangerous.{2}
Lunpa's reputation is{3}very bad nowadays.{2}
Somehow, the north has{3}become the center of{3}much attention lately.{1}Why is that?{2}
A merchant from Vault{3}had been saying many{3}things about the north...{1}Then the soldiers came{3}and took him to{3}Lord Hammet's Palace.{2}
Three years ago, thieves{3}raided Mt. Aleph...{3}It was quite a story.{1}Ever since, the north{3}lost its reputation for{3}being a safe place.{2}
They say other northern{3}parts are dangerous too.{1}Maybe our town is the{3}only place that's{3}still safe.{2}
No one is allowed to go{3}to Vault, even though the{3}bridge has been rebuilt.{1}But I doubt it's{3}because of the eruption{3}of Mt. Aleph.{2}
I do not want my son{3}to face any danger.{1}I am actually grateful{3}for Lady Layana's orders.{2}
I'm an adult, now.{3}I don't want my father{3}ordering me around...{2}
I don't care how my son{3}feels. I can't allow{3}him to go north.{2}
The most important skill{3}for a merchant is the{3}ability to discern quality.{1}Anyone who can do that{3}can be a successful{3}merchant these days.{2}
My son received his{3}knack for business from{3}Lord Hammet.{2}
The most important thing{3}is not to betray your{3}customer's trust in you.{1}Lord Hammet's lessons are{3}more precious to me{3}than treasure.{1}They will make me a{3}lot of money!{2}
My son is very tight{3}with money, even when it{3}comes to me.{1}I feel like I am living{3}with a merchant...{3}Actually, he is one!{2}
Lord Hammet sells all{3}his best weapons{3}elsewhere.{1}These weapons are good,{3}but they're not the{3}best Kalay makes.{2}
We would be able to make{3}more money if he left{3}more good weapons here.{2}
Did you find what you{3}needed in the{3}Weapon Shop?{30}
Then you'll like our{3}armor, too.{2}
Ah...{5} You seek only{3}the finest items.{1}Kalay's weapons and{3}armor are without equal.{2}
Weapons and armor from{3}Tolbi may be stronger, but{3}ours have soul.{2}
Lady Layana shared in{3}Lord Hammet's hardships{3}when he built Kalay.{1}Her love for this town{3}is why we flourish.{2}
The aqueducts in Hammet{3}Palace are another reason{3}Kalay flourished.{2}
Are you going to{3}Tolbi also?{30}
Oh, so you must be{3}taking the Colosso{3}tour, too...{1}The annual Colosso{3}festival starts in{3}Tolbi soon.{2}
Merchants are always{3}coming up with new ideas.{3}A Colosso tour... Ha!{1}They're meeting in the{3}restaurant... It must be{3}time for them to leave.{2}
Everyone is going to{3}Tolbi to see the Colosso{3}carnival there.{1}Kalay will feel so empty.{2}
I've signed on for{3}a tour group going{3}to Tolbi.{1}I can't believe it's{3}almost time for Colosso{3}to begin!{2}
The Colosso gladiators{3}are all strong, muscular{3}men!{2}
Please finish eating if you{3}are taking the tour!{5}{3}We'll be leaving soon!{2}
Everyone looks forward{3}to going to Tolbi{3}once a year.{1}Tolbi has many spots{3}to visit besides Colosso,{3}like Tolbi Springs.{2}
Surely Lord Hammet will{3}pop up in Tolbi.{1}He loves Colosso.{2}
I would have entered{3}Colosso if I were only{3}a little younger.{1}What a shame.{2}
Many of the guests here{3}seem to be heading to{3}Tolbi.{2}
Aren't you going to{3}Colosso? You guys are{3}warriors!{1}All warriors dream{3}of winning fame in{3}Colosso!{2}
Do you know about the{3}continent south of Tolbi?{30}
The guest next door{3}is dressed like he comes{3}from Gondowan.{2}
That continent is called{3}Gondowan. It is very{3}large.{1}They say that it is the{3}second largest continent{3}next to Angara.{1}I hear it is very{3}warm in Gondowan.{2}
I better get ready!{3}The Colosso Tour{3}is about to leave!{1}We're going all the{3}way to Tolbi to see the{3}Colosso.{1}I hope we can visit the{3}southern continent, too.{2}
We fled from Gondowan,{3}to the south.{1}We lived in Lalivero,{3}which was a great village{3}until the Tolbians came.{2}
Lalivero, where I'm from,{3}is the largest village{3}in Gondowan.{1}Kalay is quite large, too,{3}but it's a little too{3}noisy around here.{2}
If you are entering{3}Colosso{5}, you don't stand{3}a chance of winning...{1}because this year, both{3}of us are entering.{2}
We're so strong, making{3}the finals will be{3}a piece of cake!{1}Then, Ouranos and I will{3}fight each other for{3}the championship.{2}
He's a shrewd merchant{3}if he can turn travel{3}into a business.{1}I'm impressed that he's{3}got so many customers.{2}
Every year, everyone{3}goes to Tolbi for Colosso.{3}We can't help that...{2}
Joining a tour group is{3}the only way to travel.{3}Every need is cared for.{2}
I wonder which warrior{3}will win Colosso this year.{3}I can't wait!{2}
It's business, so you{3}can't help it, but{3}many of these folk{1}aren't used to{3}traveling.{2}
I'm exhausted from{3}preparing this tour.{1}I can't wait until I'm{3}in Tolbi and I can{3}rest a bit...{2}
I was so excited, I{3}couldn't sleep last night.{3}But I have to keep cool.{1}I don't want anyone to{3}know this is my{3}first time at Colosso.{2}
My animal instincts start{3}waking up as soon as{3}I see the Colosso battles!{2}
Colosso is so...common.{3}What's so great about it?{2}
I'm going to sign up for{3}Colosso as soon as I{3}arrive in Tolbi.{1}There may be more{3}like me, though.{2}
People from the continent{3}south of Angara have{3}rich, bronze skin.{2}
I'm pretty excited,{3}because this is my first{3}time visiting Tolbi.{1}Let's hurry up and{3}get going!{2}
I fled all this way. Now I{3}won't get in trouble{3}for speaking the truth.{1}How wonderful it is{3}to be free!{2}
It looks like{3}Colosso will soon{3}begin in Tolbi.{1}All this fuss just{3}to go to a festival seems{3}kind of ridiculous!{2}
I have power, and Sean{3}has speed. Together, we{3}have nothing to fear.{2}
We are the toughest of{3}all warriors. We will{3}never lose.{2}
Our inn feels so empty,{3}now that the Colosso{3}tour group has left.{2}
Even our chef left, so{3}we can't keep our{3}business open.{1}Not that it matters. We{3}will have few customers{3}until Colosso ends.{2}
Uh-oh.{5} He's still here,{3}even though his group{3}has left!{2}
We came here to escape{3}the southern lands, but{3}this city is so strange.{1}Everyone is leaving for{3}some carnival. I've never{3}seen anything like it!{2}
We escaped from the{3}northeastern region of the{3}southern continent.{1}It is so quiet here{3}now that everyone left...{3}I feel relieved.{2}
I'd have gone on the{3}Colosso Tour if I knew{3}business would be so slow.{2}
Even if my husband{3}wanted to go on the{3}Colosso tour, I would{1}never let him. There's no{3}telling what he'd do{3}without me watching him.{2}
I can't seem to relax, now{3}that everyone is gone.{3}Maybe I should go back...{2}
I wonder what Colosso{3}is like. Is it really{3}that great?{1}Wait...{5} I didn't flee{3}Lalivero to go to Tolbi.{2}
I was so scared coming{3}to Angara from Gondowan,{3}where Lalivero is.{1}Now I'm beginning to feel{3}like I am truly free.{2}
This is Lord Hammet's{3}palace.{5} The lord is away.{3}Please, begone.{2}
We will happily welcome{3}visitors once Lord{3}Hammet has returned.{2}
Leave this to me.{2}
It is I... {5} Please permit{3}me to see Lady Layana.{2}
Don't you recognize me?{5}{3}I am {17}{3}, servant{3}to Lord Hammet!{2}
{17}{3}...{5}?{2}
I didn't recognize you{24}{3}You're so tan!{3}But it really is you, {17}{3}!{2}
Oh, it's {17}{3}!{5} You've{3}grown so much in such a{3}short time, {17}{3}!{2}
Have I really changed{3}that much?{30}
Really?{5} I'm surprised...{3}It doesn't feel like{3}it's been that long...{2}
You probably wouldn't{3}know. You only met me{3}after I got left in Vault.{2}
That doesn't matter...{3}What's important is that{3}the thieves freed you!{2}
Please tell us,{3}will Lord Hammet be{3}freed soon, too?{2}
Freed?{3}Lord Hammet is{3}a prisoner?{2}
.{5}.{5}.{5}You haven't heard?{3}I can see we'll need to{3}fill you in on everything.{1}This is a private matter.{3}Would your friends{3}please leave?{30}
No, {17}{1}! There{3}are no secrets{3}between us!{2}
My companions and I{3}have overcome many{3}hardships together!{2}
Very well, then...{3}Why were you not{3}with Lord Hammet?{2}
I remained in Vault to{3}look for his stolen rod.{2}
Stolen?{3}Someone stole his rod?{2}
Yes, the Shaman's Rod.{5}{3}But I was able to{3}recover it...{2}
Then Lord Hammet must{3}still be imprisoned{3}in Lunpa...{2}
I must report this{3}to Lady Layana!{2}
{17}{3}, come see Lady{3}Layana with me... You can{3}explain it all to her.{2}
{17}{1}, you saw Lord{3}Hammet heading north,{3}didn't you?{30}
That must have been when{3}Lord Hammet went{3}toward Lunpa.{2}
No, I mean the day Lord{3}Hammet went toward{3}Lunpa...{2}
Lady Layana will surely{3}be glad to hear{3}your tale.{1}Please, come with me,{3}and tell her the{3}full story.{2}
When I heard that you{3}were back, {17}{3}, I had{3}dared to hope...{1}that Lord Hammet had{3}returned with you.{2}
We thought Lord Hammet{3}had been released{3}from Lunpa, too.{2}
We sent the ransom money{3}they demanded, so he{3}should return soon,{5} right?{2}
What's been happening in{3}Lunpa these days?{2}
The leadership in Lunpa{3}passed from its founder,{3}Lunpa, the noble thief,{1}to his son Donpa,{3}and then to Lunpa's{3}grandson...{2}
Dodonpa is a very{3}evil man.{1}His father, Donpa,{3}is heartbroken at the{3}state of Lunpa now.{2}
When did you send{3}the ransom money?{2}
Let's see...{5} First, the{3}volcano erupted...{2}
And the ransom note{3}came right after{3}the eruption.{2}
We rushed the money{3}to them right away.{3}I remember it well.{2}
It's been quite a while{3}since the eruption...{2}
Is it possible they have{3}no intention of letting{3}Lord Hammet go?{30}
You think so, too,{3}{17}{1}?{2}
I don't want to believe{3}it either,{5} but something{3}seems wrong about this.{2}
Are you saying Dodonpa{3}won't release Hammet!?{2}
I agree with {17}{3}.{1}If they were going to{3}release him, they'd{3}have done it by now.{2}
I am sorry, Lady{3}Layana, but I think{3}{17}{3} might be right.{2}
What should we do?{5}{3}How can we rescue{3}Hammet?{2}
What... {5}What if something{3}has happened to him!?{2}
Let us handle this!{2}
My lady, this is exactly{3}what the soldiers of{3}Kalay are here for!{2}
Yes, Lady Layana!{5}{3}Please let us handle this!{2}
Command us to attack,{3}and we shall!{2}
I cannot do that...{5}{3}Not without thinking{3}it over carefully...{2}
How can we guarantee{3}Hammet's safety if we{3}send soldiers to attack?{2}
I cannot do it.{5} I{3}cannot put Hammet's{3}life at risk...{2}
Can't we do something{3}to help?{30}
Oh!{5} Well, it's about{3}time you started{3}agreeing with me, {17}{1}!{2}
What!? Look, we both{3}know Hammet's life is{3}in danger!{2}
What are you two{3}talking about?{2}
{17}{2} thinks that{3}we can help.{2}
It is too dangerous...{5}{3}If you fail, your lives{3}would be in danger, too.{2}
Besides, don't you have{3}your own quests to{3}pursue?{30}
I thought so... I knew{3}there had to be a reason{3}{17}{3} had stayed with you,{1}instead of returning{3}home directly from{3}Vault.{2}
I do not believe that...{3}{17}{3} would not have stayed{3}with you for so long{1}if you did not have an{3}important task ahead.{2}
Then what will happen{3}to Lord Hammet?{2}
Hammet is a good hostage{3}for them...{5}{3}They will not kill him.{2}
We shall wait for another{3}message from Lunpa.{2}
Lady Layana,{5} I cannot{3}leave like this...{2}
It will be fine, {17}{3}.{5}{3}Hammet would not want to{3}distract you from{24}{2}
I apologize. I have said{3}more than I should...{2}
It sounds like Hammet{3}knows about our mission{3}...doesn't it?{2}
I suppose I can keep{3}it a secret no longer...{2}
Very well,{5} I shall tell{3}you.{5}.{5}.{1}He swore an oath{3}to a Jupiter Adept.{2}
A Jupiter Adept!?{2}
Have you heard of a{3}village called Vale?{30}
You {9}{2}are{7} from Vale?{3}Really? Then the prophecy{3}was true.{2}
Give me a break! You{3}don't know Vale!? It's{3}our hometown!{2}
You are from Vale...?{3}Really? Then the prophecy{3}was true.{2}
What prophecy?{2}
Three years after the{3}terrible storm that struck{3}only Mt. Aleph...{2}
{17}{3} must depart on a{3}journey with warriors{3}from Vale...{1}So it was foretold.{2}
I've heard nothing of{3}any such prophecy.{2}
It happened several{3}years before Hammet{3}founded Kalay...{1}He was off traveling.{2}
Hammet felt he had{3}reached an impasse as{3}a merchant then.{2}
He risked his life on a{3}journey to find a new{3}source of business...{2}
He was in mortal danger{3}at the southwestern{3}edge of the world,{1}when some Adepts{3}appeared and saved{3}his life.{2}
He had lost consciousness.{3}When he awoke, he found{3}himself in their village.{2}
Just a moment... Am I{3}from that village?{2}
Yes.{5} The Adept gave him{3}the Shaman's Rod{5} and you...{3}along with some doubloons.{2}
Doubloons...{5}{5} Were they{3}{5}golden doubloons?{2}
Yes...{5} Let's see...{3}You are...called...{2}
I am {17}{4}, Lady Layana.{2}
It was a lot of gold, {17}{4},{5}{3}but he also received{3}some business advice.{2}
Business advice? Hammet?{3}The greatest merchant{3}ever known?{2}
Yes, {17}{2}{5}. Hammet{3}has the Adepts to thank{3}for his success.{2}
Wow... I've never heard{3}anything like that...{2}
He was advised to buy{3}silk in Xian and sell{3}it in Tolbi.{2}
To see anything sell{3}so well, it's like a{3}dream come true.{2}
There's no denying that{3}was when Hammet picked{3}up his knack for business.{2}
Did he have to promise{3}them anything in return?{2}
Ah, yes, {17}{3}...{5} It is{3}something you will{3}need on your journey.{2}
Something we need on{3}our journey...{2}
The Adept asked Hammet{3}to use the Shaman's Rod{3}to obtain it.{2}
He looked for this{3}object wherever he{3}went...{1}But he could never{3}find it.{2}
Then, three years ago, a{3}storm struck, one that hit{3}only Mt. Aleph...{2}
Hammet was worried{5}{5} that{3}time{5} was running out...{2}
But he had managed{3}to unearth a clue{3}just in time.{2}
That, {17}{3}, is why he took{3}you with the caravan on{3}his last journey north.{2}
I had no idea...{5} So that{3}must be why he left the{3}rod in my care.{5}{5} But then{24}{2}
No, {17}{3}...{5} You mustn't{3}blame yourself...{2}
It was my carelessness{3}that caused the rod to{3}be stolen. And ultimately,{1}that's why Lord Hammet{3}is being held in{3}Lunpa...{2}
You must continue your{3}journey and complete your{3}quest.{1}You can't blame yourself.{2}
But what will happen{3}to Hammet?{2}
I will handle this.{2}
And don't forget the{3}soldiers of Kalay!{2}
Continue on your journey,{3}and do not worry about{3}Hammet!{2}
I am sorry I cannot tell{3}you more about the{3}Shaman's Rod...{2}
No,{5} don't apologize...{2}
The Shaman's Rod'll help us{3}find that thing we need{3}for our quest, right?{2}
Will you look for it?{30}
If {17}{1} says we will,{3}then there's nothing{3}to worry about!{2}
What's wrong with you,{3}{17}{1}? Did you forget{3}why we're here?{2}
If we need it for our{3}quest, we'll have to{3}find it sooner or later.{2}
Very well...{5} Take care{3}of yourselves.{2}
Return to your posts,{3}everyone!{2}
Dodonpa is a very shrewd{3}man. He may have sent{3}spies into Kalay.{1}We can't risk sending{3}our soldiers yet.{2}
The townsfolk don't{3}know about Lord Hammet{3}yet, do they?{2}
Lord Hammet will be{3}released soon. Right?{30}
I hope so. Otherwise,{3}Layana will be{3}overwhelmed by sorrow.{2}
It wouldn't hurt you to{3}lie a little, you know!{2}
Layana is putting up a{3}strong front whenever{3}people are around.{1}It's so hard to{3}see her like this.{2}
Merchants are supposed{3}to be protected under{3}the laws of Angara.{1}Dodonpa must truly be{3}evil to break such a law!{2}
Has the legacy of Lord{3}Hammet's silk trading{3}come to an end?{30}
How can you say that!{3}Lady Layana would be{3}devastated!{2}
You're right. I never{3}should have said that.{3}I feel terrible now.{2}
Is this the right{3}decision, Hammet?{3}Am I making a mistake?{2}
I'm sure the villagers{3}would panic if they knew{3}Hammet was a hostage...{1}We must be sure we do{3}not show it...{2}
Everyone's worried about{3}Lord Hammet, but no one{3}can talk about it openly.{1}If he isn't freed, it will{3}mean the end of Kalay...{2}
Lady Layana was crying{3}again last night.{1}I wish there were{3}something I could do.{2}
And to think...{3}I almost went on that{3}caravan with Hammet!{2}
Lord Hammet is a legend{3}among merchants. Kalay{3}can't survive without him.{2}
{17}{1}{5}, you sneaked into{3}Lunpa? That's far too{3}dangerous!{2}
But{5} I am happy to{3}learn that Hammet{3}is not hurt.{2}
Thank you, {17}{1}...{5}{3}But please, do not go{3}to Lunpa again.{2}
Please, fulfill your quest.{2}
Dodonpa plans to use{3}Hammet to get every last{3}penny he can from Kalay.{1}We shall have to{3}appease him until{3}we can rescue Hammet.{2}
I don't care about the{3}money, as long as Hammet{3}comes home safely...{2}
The soldiers of Kalay{3}will handle this{3}matter ourselves.{1}Please, go on with your{3}journey, as Lady Layana{3}requested.{2}
We'll take care of{3}this kidnapping incident{3}just fine.{1}You should continue on{3}your quest.{2}
I'm worried about Lord{3}Hammet, but Lady Layana{3}insists we do nothing.{1}I can only hope for{3}Lord Hammet's safety...{2}
The warriors of Kalay{3}will save Lord Hammet,{3}no matter the toll.{2}
The people in the inn{3}were tourists going to{3}see the Colosso.{1}All that fuss just to{3}see a carnival in Tolbi!{3}I don't get it.{2}
What's with you?{3}You wanna enter Lunpa?{30}
Well, you can't!{3}Go back to where{3}you came from!{2}
You came all this way{3}for nothing? That{3}doesn't make any sense...{1}Lunpa's no place for{3}people like you. Go back{3}where you came from!{2}
You're not from Kalay,{5}{3}are you?{30}
That last group said the{3}same thing, but we{3}didn't trust them, either.{1}Leave now if you don't{3}want to get hurt.{2}
You're not here to{3}save Hammet,{5} are you?{30}
We'll return Hammet to{3}Kalay very soon. Just{3}wait a little longer...{1}That's what Dodonpa{3}told us to say.{2}
Oh, please! No one would{3}come to Lunpa unless{3}it was to save Hammet!{1}You don't want to make{3}me angry. You wouldn't{3}like me when I'm angry!{2}
I wonder if these guys{3}will try to enter from the{3}cave west of town?{1}Well, the gate there is{3}too heavy for them to{3}lift, anyway. No worries!{2}
Even if they enter{3}through the cave, they{3}can't get into town.{1}The gate in the cave{3}can only be opened{3}from the inside.{2}
Have you been in Lunpa{3}long?{30}
Hmm... Your face doesn't{3}ring a bell. I guess you{3}don't really stand out.{2}
Oh, so you're a new{3}member of Dodonpa's{3}gang?{2}
We've had no freedom{3}ever since the caravan{3}came to the village.{1}We can't leave the{3}village, and no one is{3}allowed in. I hate it...{2}
Is it true that Dodonpa{3}kidnapped Hammet and{3}extorted ransom for him?{30}
Then I guess Dodonpa's{3}men were telling the{3}truth.{2}
I didn't think so. Not{3}even Dodonpa would do{3}such a terrible thing.{2}
Donpa is too old to lead,{3}so his men do whatever{3}Dodonpa says.{2}
The righteous thief, Lunpa,{3}and his son, Donpa{24}{3}They were great men.{2}
Donpa has no idea what{3}Dodonpa is doing.{1}This village would change{3}if Donpa heard about{3}Dodonpa's evil deeds...{2}
You want to see Donpa?{30}
Donpa is in the fortress.{3}You'll have to go there{3}if you want to see him.{1}But security at the{3}fortress is very tight.{2}
I didn't think so...{3}It's impossible to{3}see Donpa now.{2}
The chef from the inn{3}has been delivering meals{3}to the fortress lately.{1}He says security is very{3}tight{24}even inside the{3}fortress.{2}
Don't come any closer.{2}
How can Dodonpa be so{3}devious?{1}I can't believe he{3}is the son of Donpa.{2}
Not even a mouse could{3}enter this fortress{3}while I'm on the watch!{2}
I doubt anyone could{3}enter Lunpa now with all{3}this tight security.{2}
It sure was strange{3}of Hammet to come here{3}just to get caught.{2}
Once they get the ransom,{3}they'll set the hostages{3}free, no matter what.{1}But the merchant caravan{3}hasn't left yet.{3}What's going on?{2}
Lunpa died when Donpa{3}was still young. It{3}made Donpa a lonely man...{1}They say that's why he{3}spoiled Dodonpa so much...{3}What a mistake that was.{2}
Dodonpa can do his evil{3}deeds, but how can he{3}live like this?{1}If he makes any money,{3}he should pass it around{3}to us poor villagers.{2}
Dodonpa keeps Donpa{3}hidden away in the{3}fortress so that he won't{1}find out about all the{3}evil things Dodonpa has{3}been up to.{2}
The fortress is guarded{3}all day long.{1}No one outside the{3}fortress can get in to{3}see Donpa.{2}
The chef said the{3}fortress is so scary, he{3}never wants to go back.{2}
Dodonpa is a genius!{3}Not releasing Hammet{3}is so smart...{1}It's a great way to use{3}Hammet to keep extorting{3}money from Kalay.{2}
You'd have to be a{3}shadow to sneak past me.{2}
My late grandfather{3}traveled the continent{3}with Lunpa.{1}He would be very sad{3}to see the things{3}Dodonpa is doing now.{2}
We may live in Lunpa, but{3}we'll never work for{3}Dodonpa.{2}
Lunpa used to be a good{3}place, but not anymore.{2}
They keep pushing us{3}to work for Dodonpa!{3}I can't stand it!{2}
The fortress was built{3}during Donpa's rule.{1}He built his fortress{3}so well, not even an ant{3}could sneak in.{2}
The inn's chef is the{3}only one in town who can{3}enter the fortress.{2}
The fortress was built so{3}its guards could see{3}every corner.{2}
After the caravan{3}of merchants was{3}captured...{1}That was when they{3}ordered the chef inside{3}the fortress.{2}
Lunpa passed away long{3}ago, when the world was{3}hit by a huge flood.{1}Lunpa had gone south{5}...{3}and he was never seen{3}again after the flood.{2}
Lunpa was caught in the{3}great flood while traveling{3}with someone named Babi.{2}
They say the flood claimed{3}many lives, all across{3}the continent.{2}
What kind of name{3}is Babi, anyway?{2}
The village is sealed,{3}so we can't buy or sell{3}anything.{1}Dodonpa doesn't care{3}about my business.{2}
I'll sell you as much{3}armor as you like, once{3}the village is reopened.{2}
They bought a lot of{3}stock, which is why{3}they're holding up,{1}but I still feel bad{3}for them and all{3}the lost business.{2}
Do you want to sleep at{3}my place?{30}
You must be kidding.{3}Go rest in your{3}own home!{2}
Of course not! With no{3}travelers in town, no one{3}wants to stay here.{2}
Dodonpa made a pretty{3}penny for himself by{3}capturing Hammet,{1}but he doesn't care{3}about what happens to{3}us villagers at all.{2}
It doesn't matter how{3}much we clean or wait{3}for customers.{1}No one will come.{2}
Do you want to hear{3}about how I delivered{3}meals to the fortress?{30}
I was blindfolded and{3}guided along a cool path.{3}I walked for a while.{1}I heard my footsteps{3}echoing, so it must have{3}been an underground path.{2}
I was so relieved when{3}I got back to the{3}village.{1}The guy I delivered{3}food to? They called{3}him Hammet.{2}
I just have to hang in{3}there. I'm not closing my{3}inn 'til the village is free.{2}
Dodonpa doesn't care{3}about anyone but himself.{3}That's why he does this...{2}
At this rate,{3}I'll be fired before{3}I know it...{2}
I feel bad for that poor{3}man they've got locked{3}up in the dungeon...{2}
I think that thief Dodonpa{3}is a terrible man.{1}But it's not fair to blame{3}the Lunpans for it.{3}They need our care, too.{2}
We can't leave Lunpa{24}{3}not when Dodonpa's men{3}are watching like that.{2}
I'll have to close this{3}shop soon if things{3}don't change...{2}
I should have bought{3}more stock while I{3}had the chance...{2}
I bought a lot of{3}stock, but I'm already{3}running out...{2}
This is Lunpa. You{3}cannot enter without{3}Dodonpa's authorization.{2}
If outsiders cause any{3}trouble in the village,{1}Dodonpa will hold{3}us responsible.{2}
Hey,{5} if it isn't{3}{17}{1}! You came back{3}home, huh?{2}
This is Vale!{5}{3}...Wait, you already know{3}that, right, {17}{1}?{2}
Oh, {17}{1}!{3}You came back sooner{3}than I thought!{2}
It looks like you made{3}some friends in your{3}travels, {17}{1}.{1}I'm glad to see that.{2}
The river in town{3}grew so hot after{3}Mt. Aleph erupted.{1}Everyone got excited,{3}thinking there were hot{3}springs on the mountain,{1}but then the river{3}cooled down again.{2}
Did you see anything{3}interesting on your trip,{3}{17}{1}?{30}
You didn't, hmm? I can{3}see in your eyes that{3}you're not being honest.{2}
Oh, really? That must{3}have been exciting!{1}Maybe I can join you{3}on your next journey?{30}
Ha ha, really?{1}I was just kidding.{3}You don't need to be{3}so polite.{2}
Yeah... I knew you{3}would say no...{2}
Oh, my! {17}{1}!{3}How have you been!{2}
Welcome back, {17}{1}!{3}It's good to have you{3}home!{2}
I see you made many{3}friends on your journey.{1}I wish I could be{3}like you, {17}{1}.{2}
The eruption created{3}a terrible mess on the{3}other side of Mt. Aleph.{2}
The eruption caused a{3}crack to open on Mt.{3}Aleph's northwest side.{2}
You surprised us, {17}{1}!{3}You're back sooner{3}than anyone expected!{2}
{17}{1} has grown so{3}much so quickly. He{3}looks splendid...{2}
{17}{1}'s new friends{3}look interesting.{1}I wonder if they're{3}Adepts, like us?{2}
Eruptions must have{3}great power if they{3}can heat a river!{2}
I sense that Mt. Aleph is{3}not the only place to{3}see strange events.{1}Crossing the continent{3}must indeed be{3}difficult.{2}
Oh, my! When did you{3}return to Vale, {17}{1}?{2}
I wonder if we can play{3}with {17}{1} and his pals{3}again, like we used to.{2}
I want to go on a{3}journey and make new{3}friends, too!{2}
A river of lava burnt{3}everything on the other{3}side of Mt. Aleph.{2}
The crack on Mt. Aleph's{3}northwest side is{3}widening.{1}At this rate, the whole{3}continent will split in half!{2}
The path to Sol Sanctum{3}is still closed.{1}You'll have to wait{3}until the volcanic{3}activity subsides.{2}
{17}{1}, are your new{3}friends Adepts by{3}any chance?{30}
So, there are others{3}besides Valeans who have{3}been granted Psynergy?{2}
......
......
Your friend seems{3}angered by your{3}words, {17}{1}...{1}That means...{3}they {9}{2}must{7} be Adepts!{2}
Why is it that different{3}Adepts have different{3}powers?{1}Is it because they{3}meditate more, like{3}the Great Healer?{2}
It'll be difficult to reach{3}Sol Sanctum until Mt.{3}Aleph returns to normal.{2}
I see a beautiful girl{3}has joined {17}{1}{3}on his journey.{1}I wonder what {17}{6}{3}will think when she{3}sees this.{2}
It's not fair! I want to{3}have strong Psynergy, but{3}I hate working for it.{2}
Oh, {5}it's you, {17}{1}.{3}You came back?{30}
Vale won't be very{3}quiet anymore...{1}But I'm glad to see you.{3}Your mother, Dora, will{3}be, too.{2}
Oh, you're not back for{3}good? That's too bad.{2}
I heard you were back.{3}I guess the rumor was{3}true.{1}Are you going to tell{3}us all the great tales{3}from your journey?{2}
{17}{1}! When did you{3}come back? After the{3}way you left,{1}I thought I might{3}never see you again.{1}I'm very happy to{3}see you.{2}
Ow!{5} It's gonna be years{3}before I'm a grown-up!{3}But {17}{1}'s back already!{1}Oh...{3}You are just visiting...{3}You got me surprised.{2}
Welcome home, {17}{1}!{3}Oh...{5} ...{3}What happened?{1}Why are you walking{3}around with some girl{3}who's not {17}{6}?{2}
We've seen many monsters{3}lately, and it's become{3}quite dangerous outside{1}the village.{3}That's why weapons{3}are selling well.{1}If only the blacksmiths{3}could make better{3}weapons...{2}
I wish I could learn the{3}secret to making{3}good weapons...{2}
I gave him a farewell{3}gift thinking I'd{3}never see him again...{1}But I didn't have to...{1}And wasn't he supposed{3}to bring {17}{6} back{3}with him...?{2}
I promised I'd become{3}a great blacksmith before{3}{17}{1} comes back again.{1}It's a man's promise,{3}and I have to keep it.{2}
That shy girl with{3}{17}{1}{5} sure looks{3}like a nice girl.{2}
What happened to {17}{6}?{3}Haven't you found{3}her yet?{2}
Well if it isn't {17}{1}!{1}You've grown so much,{3}I almost didn't{3}recognize you!{2}
Oh, it's you, {17}{1}.{3}You came back, huh?{2}
You've come all the way{3}home just to stay{3}here? Are you sure?{30}
Oh, I see... You don't want{3}to get used to staying{3}at home...{1}In that case, you're{3}more than welcome...{2}
That's better! You've come{3}all the way back. Now,{3}go on home.{2}
You traveled around the{3}eastern edge of the{3}continent?{1}You must be{3}exhausted!{2}
Aren't you glad to see{3}the village hasn't{3}changed?{2}
Does {17}{1} know that{3}Dora was struck with{3}an illness?{2}
I wonder if {17}{1}{3}came here because Dora{3}wouldn't let him stay...{1}Other than the mayor,{3}no one else knows{3}about Dora's illness...{2}
I wonder if {17}{1} will{3}continue his journey.{3}It must be quite difficult.{2}
Vale will never change,{3}so you can come{3}home whenever you like.{2}
Hey...{2}
What?{2}
Shouldn't we look{3}for {17}{2}?{2}
Why?{2}
{17}{1} still doesn't know{3}about Dora...{5}right?{3}Someone should tell him.{2}
You miss {17}{2}, don't you?{3}You're looking for an{3}excuse to find him.{2}
What? No! I just...{2}
{9}{4}Guh...{5}{5} Gah...{5} Ugh...{2}
Grandma! What's the{3}matter? Are you{3}choking?{2}
It's... It's {17}{2}!{2}
She must miss{3}{17}{2}, too...{2}
No, it's really {17}{2}!{3}Look, look!{2}
{17}{2}!{30}
Oh, {17}{2}...!{30}
Mom, Dad...{5} I'm home...{2}
What,{5} {17}{2}?{2}
Oh, {17}{2}...!{2}
Grandpa,{3}I'm home...{2}
Yes, yes...{5} Did you{3}complete your mission{3}for the Wise One?{30}
Oh, you mean it's going{3}well? You probably have{3}to continue on soon, then.{2}
Not yet? Well, I'm glad{3}you're home, even if it's{3}just for a little while...{2}
You're leaving again{3}soon...aren't you?{2}
I'm just glad to see{3}you're doing well!{2}
That's right.{2}
Let me introduce you{3}to my new friends.{2}
Umm...{5} I am {17}{3}.{3}Pleased to meet you.{2}
I am {17}{4}, from Imil.{3}Nice to meet you.{2}
Nice to meet you.{3}Please look after{3}young {17}{2} for us.{2}
Well{5}, enough chit-chat.{3}Relax and enjoy your{3}stay here...{2}
{17}{4} is such a{3}nice girl.{1}I wonder who {17}{2}{3}likes more, {17}{4} or{3}{17}{6}...{2}
That {17}{3} seems to be{3}a smart boy...{1}I wish you could be more{3}like {17}{3}, {17}{2}.{2}
Did you hear us talking{3}about Dora just now?{30}
Dora told us not to{3}worry...that it's just{3}a fever.{1}Don't worry too much,{3}{17}{1}.{2}
You didn't hear? But you{3}look concerned.{1}We'll be looking after{3}your mother, so don't{3}worry.{2}
I hope you didn't get{3}sick during your{3}travels...{1}{17}{2} always eats{3}too much... He always{3}makes his mother worry.{2}
It must be nice to be{3}young and gallivant{3}about with lovely girls!{2}
His new friends are all{3}so polite. I'm very happy{3}to see that.{2}
It wasn't too smart to{3}talk about Dora without{3}checking for {17}{1}.{1}I wish we could tell{3}him the truth.{2}
{17}{2} seems to have{3}grown up a bit on{3}this difficult journey.{2}
Ah!{2}
It's been a while...{2}
You're back?{2}
Have you gone home{3}to see Dad yet?{30}
Really?{5} He must have{3}been happy to see you.{1}He has been so{3}worried about you.{2}
You have to see him...{5}{3}He's been worried{3}about you.{2}
...{5}So have I.{2}
Sis...{2}
Don't get me wrong.{5} I...{3}I was just worried you{3}might get into trouble,{1}because, you know,{3}you're not that bright...{2}
Yeah, all right...{3}Thanks, Sis.{2}
So, {5}{5}are you home{3}for good? Or...{2}
Not just yet...{2}
You're leaving...{5}{3}again?{2}
Don't push yourself too{3}hard...{5}when you{3}leave again.{2}
Hey, how have you been?{2}
Oh,{5} {17}{2}!{3}And {17}{1}!{2}
What happened!?{3}You're back already!?{2}
Already? What kind of{3}way is that to{3}greet us?{2}
But{24}But they said{3}you might never come{3}back!{2}
And it still seems like{3}you're not back for good,{3}like you're just visiting.{2}
Really?{5} Is that{3}what it seems like?{2}
Yeah... You and your{3}friends... You all look like{3}you are about to leave.{2}
You're smarter than{3}you look.{2}
I have to shape up{3}while you're gone, right?{3}If not...{2}
Hey, the family'll be fine,{3}as long as you're here!{3}Am I right, or what?{30}
Take care of our family{3}while I'm gone.{3}All right?{2}
Hey! You're not{3}helping here!{2}
WHAT{5}EVER{5} YOU{5} DO{5},{3}you must protect the{3}family while I'm gone.{1}All right? I'm counting{3}on you!{2}
Don't push yourself{3}too hard,{5}{5} OK?{2}
I can tell just by looking{3}at you that you've been{3}through a lot.{1}You look so much{3}more mature now.{2}
I will do my best to{3}show everyone that I{3}am strong enough{1}to protect our family{3}and Vale.{2}
You guys are working so{3}hard, but I'm worried.{3}Are you really all right?{2}
I could go with you if I{3}were a little older...{3}It's not fair...{2}
{9}{4}Cough, cough{5}{5}! {7}Who is it?{5}{3}Is it the innkeeper?{5}{5}{3}Is it time to eat?{2}
No? {9}{4}Cough...{7}{5}{5}{3}Then who{24}{2}
{17}{1}...{2}
Are you finally home?{3}Have you completed{3}your mission!?{2}
You haven't, have you?{2}
Have you forgotten your{3}promise, {17}{1}?{2}
You promised you wouldn't{3}come back until your{3}quest was complete, right?{30}
You broke your promise{3}because you were worried{3}about me?{2}
You were more worried{3}about me than about{3}keeping your promise?{2}
Who told you I was ill?{3}The mayor? Or {9}{4}cough{7}{3}...was it the innkeeper?{30}
So you came because{3}you were worried after{3}hearing about me.{2}
Are you telling me{3}you were surprised to{3}see me in bed?{2}
You can't get out of your{3}promises just because{3}you're worried about me.{1}{9}{4}Cough...{7}{2}
I... {9}{4}Cough...{7}{5}{3}I just caught a{3}cold. That's all.{2}
But I'm fine now. {5}{5}{3}{9}{4}Cough...{7}{5} Look!{2}
See?{5} I'm fine!{2}
Don't worry about me.{3}Go on. Do your best to{3}complete your quest.{5}{5} OK?{2}
Don't you worry about{3}me. Just do your best{3}to complete your quest.{1}{9}{4}Cough cough...{7}{2}
I'm sorry I seemed so{3}harsh, {17}{1}...{1}I'm so happy to see you.{3}I'll be waiting for you to{3}come home for good...{2}
{9}{4}Unn...{5} Ohh...{5}{5}{3}Kyle...{5} Don't go...{2}
I think Dora{3}is dreaming.{2}
Kyle, watch out!{5}{5}{3}The boulder!!!{5}{3}The boulder...{2}
Oh, so you still haven't{3}rescued {17}{6}...{2}
I get over colds quickly.{1}But it sure is taking{3}Dora a long time to{3}recover from hers.{2}
A cold is going around.{3}I should be careful.{2}
Will I ever see {17}{6}{3}and {17}{5} again{3}before I die?{2}
Dora says it's just a{3}cold, but she's been like{3}this ever since...{1}{17}{1} left...{3}It's taking her so{3}long to recover...{2}
I know that there are{3}always cold outbreaks{3}when winter comes...{1}But still...{2}
What was that "Alchemy"{3}that Kraden was always{3}researching?{1}I feel it was{3}something that was{3}better left alone...{2}
Earthquakes still strike{3}once in a while...{1}It gives me the{3}chills every time...{2}
Even if the eruption{3}had no relation to{3}Alchemy...{1}I still don't want{3}Kraden to come back{3}to the village.{2}
Every time the ground{3}shakes, I worry there{3}will be another eruption.{2}
The mountain is apparently{3}still casting Psynergy{3}Stones about.{1}People who have been{3}beyond the gate say{3}they've seen them{1}beside the roadside.{2}
If the Psynergy Stones{3}in the mountain{3}continue to be scattered...{1}Mt. Aleph won't have{3}any Psynergy Stones left{3}someday.{2}
The northwest face of Mt.{3}Aleph was all scorched by{3}a river of lava.{2}
They say the lava looked{3}like the bowels of the{3}earth had spilt forth.{2}
The Great Healers are{3}too afraid to go to Sol{3}Sanctum anymore.{1}They have nothing to fear.{3}Their Psynergy should{3}protect them.{2}
The healers are supposed{3}to guard Sol Sanctum.{3}How can they not go in?{2}
I can't stop wondering{3}what lies beyond{3}this fence.{2}
Oh, {5}it's {17}{1}, isn't it?{3}Is {5}{17}{6}{5} back yet?{1}Promise me, {17}{1}...{3}{5}Promise me you'll bring {17}{6}{3}with you next time.{2}
Promise me, {17}{1}...{3}{5}Promise me you'll bring{3}{17}{6} back home.{2}
You didn't bring{3}{17}{6} with you?{2}
I still remember when{3}{17}{5} and I used to{3}play here...*Sniff*{2}
{17}{5} must be{3}protecting {17}{6}...{3}I'm sure of it.{2}
I was trying to catch that{3}fish, and you killed it.{3}Why did you do that?{2}
So there were{3}monstrous fishes{3}in this river?{2}
Hey!{5} Where'd that{3}Psynergy Stone go?{3}It's gone!{2}
All that's left is a{3}big hole in my roof.{1}But the memory of the{3}eruption won't go away,{3}even once I've fixed it.{2}
You must have so many{3}memories of this{3}cottage, don't you?{30}
I thought so. You{3}used to visit Kraden{3}a lot, {17}{1}.{2}
I understand. You{3}don't have time to{3}dwell on old memories...{2}
Mt. Aleph's eruption was{3}so powerful, it caused{3}the continent to crack!{2}
Aghh!{5} I felt another one!{2}
They've been going on{3}for a while. I can't even{3}sleep at night!{2}
They say the danger is{3}gone, even though the{3}earthquakes continue...{2}
I wonder why we haven't{3}seen any travelers{3}since the eruption...{1}Do you know why,{3}{17}{1}?{30}
Oh, the bridge to the{3}south was ruined?{3}That explains it.{2}
You don't know either?{3}It's not like we banned{3}visitors after the eruption.{2}
I have a feeling my{3}adventures will begin{3}once I pass this fence.{2}
There are definitely{3}monstrous fish in this{3}river.{2}
No ordinary fish could{3}make a splash like{3}that!{1}That would take a{3}MONSTER FISH!{2}
Aww.. I wish I could{3}show that fish to{3}everyone...{1}Then I could prove to{3}everyone that I was{3}right!{2}
You mean it wasn't just{3}monstrous, but was{3}actually a monster?{1}{3}Wow! That's incredible.{2}
The impact from the{3}eruption was too much for{3}the people of Vale.{2}
I wonder why I feel so{3}lonely whenever I come{3}here...{1}I wasn't even that{3}close to Kraden...{2}
The earthquakes aren't{3}caused by eruptions.{1}I think they're from{3}the continent splitting{3}into two.{2}
Ahh... I can't stand{3}these earthquakes!{3}I wish they'd stop!!!{2}
The smoke from Mt. Aleph{3}isn't thick at all.{3}It looks okay now.{2}
Having no travelers{3}is no fun at all...{2}
You! You're the warriors{3}who captured the thieves{3}a while back, aren't you?{1}You've returned to Vault!{2}
You've probably already{3}heard, but the bridge{3}to Kalay has been fixed.{2}
I wonder what happened{3}to Hammet when he{3}went to Lunpa...{2}
There have been rumors{3}of thieves from Lunpa{3}running wild,{1}but we haven't been{3}paying them much mind.{1}I wonder why those guys{3}have been so quiet{3}recently.{2}
Oh, it's you... I was just{3}talking about you with{3}our mayor.{1}You're all really strong,{3}so I say, let those thieves{3}attack!{1}They won't be able{3}to get past you!{2}
If the volcano stays calm{3}and the southern bridge{3}stays fixed,{1}we won't have any{3}worries at all.{2}
Hey, it's that{3}warrior guy!{2}
Yeah, and {17}{3}, too.{2}
I'm so glad you{3}came back to Vault!{2}
I wish Vault's elders{3}were as brave as you!{2}
Oh, so did you guys{3}check out the jail?{30}
How did those thugs{3}break out of jail?{1}The bars are{3}really strong.{2}
The thieves broke out{3}of jail and got away.{1}After you guys went{3}to all the trouble of{3}capturing them...{2}
The thieves escaped,{3}but I think it's all right.{1}It's all part of a{3}divine plan.{2}
Bow wow wow wow!{2}
I can't believe they're{3}here! What great timing!{2}
When those guys from{3}Kalay came to fix the{3}bridge,{1}they looked like{3}they were worried about{3}something.{2}
Yeah, some warriors from{3}Kalay came to Vault{3}asking about Hammet.{1}Did Hammet get captured{3}after all?{2}
Once Dodonpa took over,{3}Lunpa's outlaws became no{3}better than thieves.{1}There's gotta be a{3}reason those guys are{3}being so quiet.{2}
Those stupid thieves{3}escaped, and we don't{3}know where they are.{1}They hated these kids{3}for capturing them.{3}I wonder if they'd...{2}
It would have been great{3}to have everything solved{3}before winter came.{2}
Watching you guys makes{3}me feel brave.{1}I hope you'll tell{3}me all about your{3}travels sometime.{2}
Grown-ups always get so{3}scared whenever anything{3}happens.{1}I get so tired{3}of that...{2}
It's not like it's{3}easy to grab the{3}key to that jail.{1}They were able to get{3}the key out, so they know{3}the secret of the lock...{1}That must have{3}been great!{2}
I keep wondering... Was{3}our statue stolen because{3}my conduct was{5}{5} wrong?{2}
If you bring me some{3}bones, I'll tell you{3}a secret.{2}
Owwwoooooh!{2}
Bow wow wow!{2}
How did you know I{3}wanted one of these?{2}
{9}{4}Waah! {7}{5}{3}A cat ate my{3}precious stone!{1}That never should have{3}happened, but it's true.{2}
I thought I saw the{3}cat get up on the table{3}and paw that gemstone...{1}and then our beloved{3}treasure was gone!{2}
If I'd known this was{3}going to happen, I would{3}have sold it.{2}
My husband says my cat{3}ate the treasure, but I{3}don't believe him.{2}
The prisoners said they{3}wanted to break out of{3}jail before Colosso began.{1}Colosso... Isn't that{3}the big festival in Tolbi?{2}
Dodonpa's henchmen never{3}attacked us, did they?{1}Maybe those thieves{3}weren't from Lunpa{3}after all.{2}
Why do you suppose those{3}thieves would be so{3}interested in Colosso?{2}
Daddy hasn't been paying{3}attention, since Dodonpa's{3}men never attacked us.{2}
It's near time for Colosso{3}to start in Tolbi, isn't it?{1}I'd like to go once{3}more before I die.{2}
The warriors I saw{3}fighting at Colosso were{3}so powerful...{1}I couldn't take my{3}eyes off them.{2}
Whenever my wife used to{3}go to Tolbi for Colosso,{1}she would always check{3}out the gladiators...{1}That's why I won't{3}take her with me if{3}I go again.{2}
Lately, my husband's been{3}going on and on about{3}Colosso.{1}I wonder if he might{3}take me this year...{2}
Oh, {17}{1}!{3}You've come back{3}to Vault!{2}
Ever since you left, all{3}sorts of crazy things{3}have been happening...{2}
Those thieves you caught{3}have escaped from jail.{2}
We were worried that{3}they might come after you.{3}Have you run into them?{30}
If you see any suspicious{3}shadows, it might be them,{3}so watch out.{2}
Well, that's good...{3}But be careful. There's no{3}telling what they might do.{2}
Those guys really wanted{3}revenge on you, so take{3}good care of yourselves.{2}
The mayor's family urn{3}is on display now. You{3}ought to go see it.{2}
Those thieves!{3}You go to all that trouble{3}catching them,{1}and then we let them{3}get away.{2}
I hear that a big{3}festival is about to start{3}in some faraway town.{1}I'd sure like to see what{3}kind of festival it is{3}sometime.{2}
As long as we stay alert,{3}those thieves won't{3}give us any trouble.{2}
We'll be securing it in a{3}safe place soon, so I hope{3}they see it soon.{2}
It's just embarrassing{3}that we let those{3}thieves get away.{2}
I love festivals!{3}I'll bet Colosso is{3}just incredible.{2}
There's a river of fire{3}on the other side{3}of Mt. Aleph.{1}Something big is happening.{2}
Just imagine how terrible{3}it would be if that had{3}happened over here!{2}
They say the volcano on{3}Mt. Aleph has torn our{3}continent in two!{1}The eruption of Mt. Aleph{3}was incredible, big enough{3}to split the continent.{2}
It's a good thing that{3}giant crevasse opened{3}up, though.{1}Otherwise, the lava flow{3}would have spilled{3}directly into us!{2}
We haven't been getting{3}many customers lately.{1}Maybe I'll close{3}early today.{2}
Why keep the store{3}open if we don't have{3}any customers?{2}
I may be wrong, but lately,{3}there seem to be a lot of{3}earthquakes on Mt. Aleph.{2}
I polished the gold{3}statue you returned{3}to us.{1}It's so shiny, you won't{3}even recognize it!{2}
I hope the earthquakes{3}aren't a sign of something{3}worse coming...{2}
That dirty golden statue{3}cleaned up pretty well.{3}Sure makes me feel good.{2}
Mmmm. Nothing to do,{3}nothing to do. I hate this!{1}It's all because no one's{3}coming to the village, what{3}with the volcano and all.{2}
We don't get a lot of{3}travelers in winter.{1}Spring seems like such{3}a long way off,{3}you know?{2}
I did some cooking, so{3}now I've got all these{3}useless bones.{1}...You want some?{30}
Oh, you do? Really?{3}Help yourself, take as{3}many as you like.{2}
You're right. You can't{3}just live on bones,{3}now can you?{2}
There, you see? The roof{3}repairs are all finished.{2}
Won't anyone come stay{3}the night here? It could{3}be a thief, for all I care.{2}
After you've been in this{3}business for a while, you{3}start to understand...{1}After hard times, good{3}times will come again.{2}
He really likes bones.{3}Hmm... I wonder if he's{3}got a calcium deficiency.{2}
That's the last of{3}the roof repairs.{3}What should I do next?{2}
I hit somebody, so they{3}put me in here. What I{3}did was stupid, wasn't it?{2}
I need to learn to{3}control my temper.{2}
Do you{5} want{3}to go to Tolbi?{30}
You can't go any further{3}along Silk Road.{1}If you're going to Tolbi,{3}you have to cross{3}the Karagol Sea.{2}
I see. {5}Well then, how{3}about taking a long{3}look around the ship?{2}
We can't take Silk{3}Road, so everyone's{3}in a pickle.{1}It's too expensive{3}to get a ticket{3}on a ship.{2}
You can't take Silk{3}Road much further{3}than this.{1}Everyone who goes to{3}check gives up and{3}comes back.{2}
Are you going to{3}take the ship?{30}
When you reach Tolbi,{3}please pass a message{3}to my daughter.{1}Her mother says that{3}tickets are too expensive{3}and she can't go there.{2}
Is that so? {5}Well, then{3}I guess I'll ask{3}someone else then.{2}
With Silk Road{3}closed, everyone will{3}have to cross by ship.{1}The captain stands to{3}make a lot of money.{2}
I can't believe how{3}expensive tickets are.{1}We've come this far,{3}and we can't take{3}Silk Road.{1}Well, it's too late{3}for us to turn back.{2}
Well, isn't this great!{3}We can't take Silk Road,{3}and Colosso is starting!{1}My daughter left Tolbi{3}to meet us at the docks.{3}I'm really sad about this.{2}
We've spent a year{3}planning this trip,{3}and now this happens.{2}
Are you looking for{3}tickets for boarding?{30}
Please buy a ticket if{3}you're planning to{3}travel by ship.{2}
Let's see...there are four{3}of you, so it will cost{3}{22} coins. Okay?{30}
You're{5} not going to do it?{3}If you don't get onboard,{3}you can't get to Tolbi.{2}
Uh oh...{5} You don't have{3}enough money. I can't{3}sell you a ticket.{2}
Uh oh...{5} You've got too{3}much equipment{24}I can't{3}give you your ticket.{1}Please come back after{3}you've organized your{3}equipment.{2}
All right then, please{3}take your ticket.{2}
Hand in your ticket{3}at the ship's plank.{2}
Hmmm, that's strange.{5}{3}Isn't the replacement ship{3}here yet?{2}
Once we've crossed the{3}Karagol, we'll reach Tolbi.{3}Ohh, I'm excited.{2}
I feel sort of bad that{3}I have to charge so much{3}for these tickets.{2}
If you've already bought{3}your ticket, hurry up and{3}board the ship.{2}
The ship won't leave here{3}till the next ship arrives.{3}That's how it works.{1}I doubt that we'll set sail{3}before the other one{3}gets here.{2}
Let's get going! I'm{3}not getting any younger...{1}Or is my husband thinking{3}of giving up on{3}Colosso this year?{2}
Today there are supposed{3}to be lots of tourists{3}on the ship.{1}We're not going to check{3}the tickets until the tour{3}group gets here.{2}
The ship will be open{3}until the tourists arrive.{3}Feel free to look around.{2}
The captain's in a good{3}mood today because we{3}have so many passengers.{2}
The captain's in a good{3}mood. That's why he{3}opened the ship up.{1}Everything's going great.{2}
Tickets, please. Please{3}show your tickets.{2}
You can't board the ship{3}without a ticket.{1}Please go and purchase{3}a ticket.{2}
Thank you very much.{3}Please board the ship,{3}and we'll set sail soon.{2}
After handing over your{3}ticket, you may board the{3}ship.{2}
We will be setting sail{3}shortly; please wait on{3}board.{2}
If you have tickets,{3}please give them to him{3}and board the ship.{2}
I don't know when we're{3}going to set sail.{3}Please ask the captain.{2}
Silk Road is blocked,{3}so the ship is pretty{3}full today.{2}
The replacement ship{3}hasn't arrived, so we{3}still can't set sail.{2}
Please board the ship and{3}wait to set sail.{2}
Do you want to{3}go ashore?{30}
Please pass through.{2}
We'll be setting sail{3}soon, so please board{3}the ship.{2}
When you're finished{3}out here, please{3}board the ship.{2}
There are a lot of{3}passengers... I wonder if{3}we'll be able to set sail.{1}Really, it makes{3}me wonder.{2}
The replacement ship from{3}Tolbi should have been{3}here by now...{1}Do you think something{3}happened while they were{3}crossing the Karagol?{2}
I wonder what could{3}have happened.{2}
You mean you still intend{3}to cross this dangerous{3}sea?{2}
It would be too big a loss{3}to let so many passengers{3}get away...{2}
Say, Kaja, how are{3}the oarsmen doing?{2}
They're fearless. There's{3}no problem there.{1}It's just that...{2}
"It's just that"...what?{2}
If a whole bunch of...them{3}appear while we're{3}crossing the sea,{1}I won't be able to{3}handle them alone.{2}
I'm sorry, but you'll have{3}to. I can't let anyone else{3}fight but you, Kaja.{2}
Remember,{5} the oarsmen{3}will have their hands full{3}rowing. They can't fight.{2}
Hmmm. What to do...{2}
It's too late to hire{3}mercenaries now...{3}There's no time.{2}
But we can't send the{3}ship out without hiring{3}some warriors.{2}
I wonder if there are{3}any other reliable{3}warriors around.{2}
This is a chance to make{3}some money. It'd really be{3}a waste to pass it up.{2}
Sending out a ship when{3}it's this dangerous... It's{3}like setting out to die.{2}
If we don't set sail now,{3}you would be admitting{3}you were afraid, Kaja...{1}That won't happen.{3}I won't let that happen.{2}
I told you, we're{3}leaving soon.{1}We'll set sail when{3}our replacement arrives!{2}
If we don't leave{3}soon, Colosso will{3}start without us!{1}Will you accept full{3}responsibility for being{3}late to Colosso?{2}
I wonder what's going on.{3}We've been waiting an{3}awfully long time.{2}
I wonder if I'm the only{3}one here who's going{3}to Tolbi to see Colosso...{2}
The Karagol is like a{3}humongous lake,{3}surrounded by land.{1}So there are no waves,{3}but the water is salty,{3}just like a real ocean.{2}
"When are we going?{3}When are we going?"{3}This guy's really pushy.{2}
Hmmm. This is so{3}frustrating...{1}Why won't anyone tell{3}me what's going on?{2}
Traveling by ship is{3}faster than walking;{3}there's no need to rush.{2}
Most of the people going{3}to Colosso set out a{3}long time ago.{2}
The Karagol Sea is pretty{3}foggy today. Maybe that's{3}why I'm so uneasy.{2}
There's nothing we can{3}do... Let's set sail!{2}
Wha-{5}What are you{3}talking about!{1}If we set sail now,{3}we'll never make{3}it to Tolbi.{2}
We'll be fine...{3}We have a protective{3}amulet!{2}
Amulet...{5} Amulet, you say...{3}You mean that little{3}anchor charm?{2}
The little anchor has{3}always protected us{3}from danger.{2}
Captain, get ahold of{3}yourself! That's just{3}foolish superstition!{2}
It's okay. We'll be fine.{3}Even if we can't find any{3}mercenaries,{1}that little charm will{3}protect us.{2}
Now then, let's hurry up!{3}Prepare to set sail!{2}
This is great...{5}{3}We'll be setting sail soon!{2}
(Not if I have anything{3}to say about it.){2}
We apologize for any{3}trouble that this{3}delay has caused.{1}Please relax and enjoy{3}the trip. We will be{3}setting sail very shortly.{2}
If it were a legitimate{3}ship, we'd be leaving now.{1}Who knows when we'll{3}reach Tolbi now...{2}
There is nothing to fear{3}as long as we have{3}our anchor charm.{1}Are we still getting{3}ready to set sail?{2}
There are monsters out{3}there... If we don't{3}prepare, we're doomed!{1}Curses!{3}If only we had some{3}powerful warriors...{2}
The longer we sit here,{3}the more time we{3}have to think.{1}I wonder what happened...{3}with our participation{3}in Colosso.{2}
Apparently, we can't{3}take Silk Road like{3}we'd planned.{1}So I guess we're the only{3}passengers who could{3}afford the tickets.{2}
There's a whole bunch of{3}really muscular men on{3}the floor below.{1}Those people are rowing{3}the oars so the ship{3}moves, right?{2}
You're going to Tolbi{3}to see Colosso,{3}too, right?{1}Once you've seen{3}Colosso, you won't want to{3}go to a regular festival.{2}
Maybe I should{3}just forget about{3}going...{2}
They're just taking{3}advantage of us,{1}selling those tickets{3}for so much money.{2}
Muscles rippling{3}everywhere...{3}looks great!{1}If we go to Colosso,{3}there'll be more guys{3}built like that, right?{2}
We left the old lady{3}back home. Now we can{3}take our time at Colosso.{2}
If we aren't going to set{3}sail right away, I'm going{3}to go ashore!{2}
Yeah, but...{5}we're going{3}to set sail real soon,{3}so please be patient.{2}
When is "real soon"?{2}
I'm asking how long real{3}soon is going to be!{2}
You're wondering when.{5}.{5}.{5}{3}Well...{2}
We're planning to go{3}see Colosso.{2}
You know, my friend{3}Ouranos here is{3}scared of ships.{2}
Ouranos? But he's huge!{2}
It's not that I'm{3}scared. I just can't{3}stand water...{2}
I'd rather be bitten{3}by poisonous spiders{3}than sail across the sea.{2}
Hmmm.{5}{3}Spiders, huh?{2}
And even Ouranos is{3}ready to cross the{3}sea right now.{2}
Well, if we're not going{3}now, then when are we{3}going to set sail?{2}
That's...{5}not an{3}easy question.{2}
You mean you wouldn't{3}know even if I asked?{2}
We're going, Ouranos.{2}
Going?{5} Where?{2}
Where else? To the{3}captain's quarters,{3}of course.{2}
What do you think you're{3}going to do in the{3}captain's quarters?{2}
Make him set sail.{2}
And what if he refuses? {2}
In that case, we'll just{3}have to do our best to{3}{5}persuade{5} him...{1}Right, Ouranos?{2}
That sounds crazy!{2}
That sounds{5} great!{3}Count me in.{2}
I don't want any{3}violence!{2}
Somebody stop them...{2}
They can't be planning{3}a mutiny...{2}
Those warriors got tired{3}of waiting, so they went{3}to see the captain. {2}
I wonder if those two{3}are planning on taking{3}over the ship.{2}
Ha hah! Those mercenaries{3}are going to yell at the{3}captain for us!{2}
Using force to launch the{3}ship? That's going too{3}far...{2}
They were just about to{3}launch the ship when...{3}They're awful.{2}
Those thugs are too{3}impatient... Trying to{3}launch the ship by force.{2}
Hee hee. If we can get{3}moving, I don't care what{3}it takes. I say, go for it!{2}
Those guys seem pretty{3}sure of their fighting{3}skills. They can do it.{2}
We can leave as soon{3}as we get our orders.{2}
Everyone rows in time{3}with this drum.{2}
Rowing is a man's job!{2}
We're the ones who make{3}the ship move.{2}
Once we cast off,{3}you just leave the{3}rest to us.{2}
You can only do hard{3}work like this while{3}you're young.{2}
Hmmm. I wonder when{3}we're going to launch...{2}
I can't wait until{3}we get to Tolbi and I{3}can stretch my wings.{2}
I hear there's an isle in{3}the middle of the Karagol,{3}but I've never seen it.{2}
From the sea, it looks{3}like Silk Road is{3}totally flooded.{2}
Enough is enough!{3}Let's set off!{2}
I love it when the{3}oars move in rhythm{3}to my drum.{2}
Everyone down here{3}gets so competitive.{2}
These big muscles are a{3}sign that we're oarsmen.{2}
We'll see to it that they{3}all have a pleasant{3}voyage!{2}
You've got to save up{3}lots of cash before you{3}get too old to row...{2}
I don't feel like rowing{3}all the way to the coast{3}of Tolbi today.{1}I wonder if this is what{3}a bad premonition feels{3}like.{2}
Spend your money while{3}you're young enough{3}to enjoy it!{1}That's the manly{3}thing to do.{2}
It seems like there would{3}be buried treasure... It's{3}that kind of island.{2}
Ha hah! If you want to go{3}to Tolbi, get on the ship!{2}
I didn't do anything...{2}
Really, I mean it...{2}
Oh!{5} At the risk of{3}sounding repetitive,{3}I didn't do anything!{2}
I hid the anchor charm...{1}No one would ever look{3}on top of the mast.{2}
Now what? You want to{3}see the captain too?{30}
Well, you don't have{3}any business here then.{3}Off with you now!{2}
You're trying to{3}launch the ship?{2}
We can't set sail in{3}this dangerous sea!{2}
What was that?{2}
We don't care about that!{1}We paid our money,{3}and now you have to{3}launch the ship!{2}
But the captain decided{3}to set sail just a{3}second ago.{2}
So...we're taking off?{2}
Yes.{5} Preparations are{3}being made right now.{2}
Well...maybe we were a{3}bit rash, running up{3}here like that.{2}
Please,{5} launch the ship{3}when you're ready.{2}
...{2}
Dangerous sea... That's{3}what you said, isn't it?{2}
It's dangerous out there...{3}Is that why you wouldn't{3}launch the ship?{2}
Yeah, I did... {5}{3}The sea is dangerous now.{3}There are monsters...{2}
Monsters, you say?{2}
Lately, we've been sighting{3}creatures never before{3}seen in the Karagol.{2}
Dangerous ones?{2}
Actually, some even came{3}onboard the ship and{3}attacked the crew.{2}
That {9}{2}IS{7} dangerous!{2}
We suspect that our{3}replacement ship might{3}have been attacked.{2}
With such dangerous{3}creatures around... You{3}might need warriors!{2}
It is certainly dangerous,{3}but the ship is okay.{3}After all, we{24}{2}
If there are monsters,{3}I'll be glad to{3}help out.{2}
Oh,{5} really?{2}
Hey, Ouranos, I thought{24}{2}
We have to make it to{3}Colosso...{5} If we're late,{3}we can't enter.{2}
That's true, but...{2}
Hey, maybe you can give{3}us a hand, too, Sean!{2}
Really?{2}
Are you really going{3}to help out?{2}
I'm a man of my word.{3}If I said I'll help,{3}I'll help.{2}
With you guys helping me{3}to keep the deck safe,{3}the ship should be okay.{2}
So, can we set off now?{2}
No... Now, we need{3}someone to protect the{3}oarsmen...{2}
Protect the oarsmen, huh?{1}You guys need some{3}warriors...{2}
You have an idea?{2}
I saw some warriors in{3}among the passengers{3}belowdecks.{2}
Do you think they'd{3}help us out?{2}
If they're from Angara,{3}they will.{2}
Hmmm... If they could help{3}out, we'd be unbeatable.{1}And, of course, we still{3}have my lucky anchor...{2}
It's gone...{2}
It's vanished!{2}
What!?{5}{3}The captain's beloved{3}anchor!{2}
The anchor...{3}Our good luck charm?{2}
Oh, that? What's the big{3}deal? So what if that{3}old trinket's gone.{2}
What do you mean,{3}"Oh, that"!?{2}
That anchor's been{3}keeping my ship{3}safe for years!{2}
It's just decorative,{3}right?{2}
Even if we find some{3}warriors, we won't make{3}it without that anchor.{1}We're not leaving!{2}
But you just said{3}we were leaving...{2}
That was when I{3}thought we still{3}had the anchor!{2}
Why all the fuss over{3}a little trinket?{2}
"Little trinket"!?{3}Weren't you listening{3}to what he said?{2}
It's not just a{3}decoration! It's a{3}good luck charm!{2}
This ship doesn't leave{3}until we find it.{2}
(What's the problem?{3}We've got some warriors{3}to help us...){2}
(Maybe we shouldn't{3}have taken it.){2}
Hey!{5} Hey, you!{3}What are you{3}doing here?{2}
You heard the captain{24}{3}This ship goes nowhere!!{2}
Oh, of all the bad{3}luck...losing my{3}lucky charm!{1}This ship can't leave{3}until we find it!{2}
Right when we found some{3}warriors to protect the{3}ship... Great...{2}
I can't believe him...{3}Refusing to leave{3}because of one charm?{2}
I had no idea he{3}was so superstitious.{1}I thought he was joking...{2}
You came to ask the{3}captain to set{3}sail, right?{30}
If we had worked{3}together, we'd be out{3}at sea right now.{1}But it's too late now...{3}Because of that charm,{3}we're not going anywhere.{2}
Heh heh... In that case,{3}why don't you take{3}a tour of the ship?{1}I may need a hand from{3}you later. I hope you'll{3}help me out.{2}
If the ship from Tolbi{3}had come, I'd feel{3}differently,{1}but at this point,{3}I'm not setting sail!{1}Hmmm... I wonder where{3}that anchor charm went.{2}
The ship won't leave dock{3}until we find that{3}anchor charm.{1}Maybe we should forget{3}about setting off.{2}
This is ridiculous... The{3}ship can't set sail because{3}of a good luck charm?{2}
That thing couldn't have{3}gotten lost on its own...{3}Did somebody hide it?{2}
I don't think anyone would{3}steal that charm... I bet{3}we find it right away.{2}
If the ship doesn't{3}leave soon, we might{3}miss Colosso.{2}
I waited too long...{3}I'll get in trouble if{3}I don't come clean.{1}I have to confess that I{3}hid it on top of the mast.{2}
Hey!{3}It's my lucky anchor!{2}
Well, look at that!{3}Did you find our{3}charm for us?{30}
It was atop the mast?{3}Why there, of all places?{2}
I... I don't know what{3}to say... Thank you.{3}Now, we can set sail.{2}
You climbed up the mast{3}to see the Crow's Nest,{3}and there it was?{1}How on earth did it{3}get up there?{2}
Thank you so much!{3}Now, I can finally launch{3}this ship.{2}
Boy, that's a relief!{3}Now we can set sail.{3}Right, Captain?{2}
Mmm, not just yet...{2}
Not yet? What's the{3}problem this time?{2}
The Karagol Sea is{3}thick with monsters...{2}
But you don't...{2}
Well, it's just like Sean{3}said. The best we can do{3}is protect the deck.{2}
We need someone to{3}protect the oarsmen.{2}
Sean, you look like you{3}have someone in mind{3}to help us...{2}
Yeah.{2}
Someone to help?{3}Who?{2}
Those warriors,{3}that's who!{2}
They may look young, but{3}each of them is a force{3}to be reckoned with.{2}
When you put it that{3}way, sure. Why not?{2}
I can't argue with that...{2}
How about it? You want{3}to join forces with us{3}and help out the ship?{30}
You lack confidence, but{3}Sean has a lot of faith{3}in you.{2}
With you at our side,{3}we'll be fine. I'm sure{3}you can protect the ship.{2}
If you want to reach{3}Tolbi, you'll give us a{3}hand so we can set sail.{2}
So, you'll help us?{3}That means we can{3}finally set sail.{2}
Oh, good! That means the{3}ship is taking off!{2}
There's just one{3}thing left to do...{2}
Oh, no... Now what?{2}
I need some volunteers to{3}help with the rowing...{3}just in case.{2}
What? Are you going to{3}ask the passengers to{3}help row the ship?{2}
The ship won't move{3}without oarsmen, so...{2}
Don't worry{24}we'll do{3}that, too!{2}
Wa-{5}Wait a minute...{3}You're supposed to{3}protect the ship!{2}
We'll need to ask the{3}other passengers.{2}
These passengers are part{3}of your tour, so why{3}don't you go ask them?{2}
This is crazy...{2}
We need you to help{3}out. Even with the{3}crazy stuff.{2}
Well then, let's all go{3}to our stations while we{3}wait for the launch.{2}
Come to think of it,{3}I don't know your name.{3}You want to tell me?{30}
Ah, {16}.{5}{3}Well then, {16},{1}I'm looking forward to{3}working with you.{2}
Well, I'll need to call{3}you something. Hmm... You{3}look like {16}.{2}
Well then, {16}...{2}
Well, everybody, let's{3}get this ship to sea!{2}
We don't know what might{3}happen before we arrive.{3}Be ready for anything.{2}
As long as we have the{3}anchor charm, we have{3}nothing to fear!{2}
Now that we have you to{3}protect the ship, we{3}ought to be leaving soon.{1}But I think it might be{3}tough to get the other{3}passengers to row...{2}
We'll have to make them{3}promise to help row{3}before we can set sail.{1}Hopefully, it won't come{3}to that, though.{2}
If we just promise to{3}help row, the ship will{3}set sail, right?{1}It's pretty easy to make{3}a promise.{2}
I'll agree to anything,{3}even rowing the ship,{1}if it means we'll finally{3}leave the dock!{2}
That sea dog Kaja is a{3}little scary, so everyone{3}agreed to help row.{1}But fighting up here suits{3}me better than rowing{3}down below!{2}
Are you serious about{3}setting sail?{1}I heard a sailor say{3}he'd seen the shadows{3}of monsters in the water.{1}Isn't this going to be{3}a little dangerous?{2}
It probably won't make{3}any difference if I make{3}them promise to row...{1}I just hope we don't have{3}to refund their money{3}at the end of the trip.{2}
Ultimately, they're just{3}being threatened into{3}helping, right?{1}No matter what happens,{3}I won't force the{3}passengers to work.{2}
Besides, rowing is a man's{3}job... Leave me out of it.{2}
Us? Help with the rowing?{3}Get serious!{1}There's no way we'd{3}ever do such hard work.{2}
You all agreed to help{3}of your own accord.{1}That's why I'd like{3}your total cooperation{3}when the time comes!{2}
These proud warriors are{3}not going to like being{3}told to row.{2}
What do you think? You{3}guys wanna trade jobs?{30}
You look so scary... You{3}say you want to trade,{3}but it's not that easy.{2}
I see. Sure, why don't{3}you take over the rowing.{2}
I figured you'd say that.{3}Fine. Rowing is fine{3}with me.{2}
All that money on tickets,{3}and now we have to row{3}the ship? Madness!{2}
Are you going to row? {30}
Hmmm. So, you have to{3}row, even though you're{3}a fighter, huh?{2}
Oh. {5}Helping to protect{3}the ship suits you{3}better, doesn't it?{1}Oh well, it doesn't matter.{3}It's not going to happen.{2}
I never thought I'd get to{3}be this age and end up{3}having to row a boat!{2}
If something happens{3}to our oarsmen, we'll{3}need the help.{1}If that happens, we'll{3}help out as warriors.{2}
Do they honestly think{3}I'm going to help row{3}the ship?{2}
I'm sure it'd be easier{3}to protect the ship than{3}it would be to row.{2}
Well, shoot! Maybe{3}we should have just{3}stayed in Kalay.{2}
Asking the passengers to{3}help out with the rowing...{1}This trip is going to{3}be plagued with problems.{2}
O, Master of the Sea,{3}protect this ship...{2}
I'll watch the seas. You{3}guys help Kaja and his{3}crew with any monsters.{2}
Yow! Those guys keep{3}staring at me...{1}I wonder if they figured{3}out I was the one{3}who hid the anchor.{2}
So, some oarsmen were{3}injured, huh?{1}No, no, I'm the lookout.{3}You need to ask someone{3}else.{2}
The lookout? But the{3}sea is so vast, how can{3}you spot anything?{2}
Our replacement never{3}arrived, but we're shoving{3}off just the same.{2}
What about the sea{3}monsters? Who's going to{3}be protecting the ship?{2}
That'll be me,{3}Ouranos, and Sean on{3}deck, and...{2}
{17}{1} and his{3}friends protecting{3}you down here.{2}
Can we really depend{3}on them?{2}
{17}{1} and his friends{3}have seen more combat{3}than even I have,{1}so there's nothing{3}to worry about.{2}
If you say so, Kaja.{3}We trust your judgment.{2}
And what will you do if{3}any of you becomes{3}incapacitated?{2}
We're not sure...{3}What happens then??{2}
Another passenger will{3}help row the ship.{2}
Don't worry about it!{3}I had a word with{3}the passengers.{2}
Who will go and{3}give the order when{3}the time comes?{2}
Hmmm.{5} Good point...{2}
You should select a{3}replacement and bring{3}him here.{2}
Rowing requires teamwork.{1}Be sure to balance the{3}two teams.{2}
That's right. If we're not{3}balanced, we won't make{3}much progress.{2}
Right. You have{3}your orders.{2}
I trust you'll all{3}do your best.{2}
Preparations...{5} Ready!{2}
Ship's course...{5} Clear!{2}
All right. Cast off!{2}
Row those oars!{2}
All right, we're off!{2}
Avast!{2}
Monsters sighted!{2}
Monsters?{2}
Aye, Captain!{3}Sea monsters!{2}
Captain, turn the rudder{3}hard to starboard!{2}
All right, I'm turning!{2}
It's no use. It's too late!{2}
{9}{4}Arrgh!{2}
Monsters belowdecks!{2}
{17}{1}! Take care of{3}these beasts and save{3}my mates!{2}
Where are you going,{3}{17}{1}? Slay the beasts{3}and save my mates!{2}
Monsters!{2}
Monsters from the deep{3}are attacking, just as the{3}captain feared!{2}
Curse those beasts!{3}They got one of our{3}oarsmen!{2}
We oarsmen may be{3}strong, but we're no{3}match for sea monsters!{2}
Fighting off the monsters{3}is your job. Hurry up{3}and take care of 'em!{2}
{9}{4}Foul beast! I may be{3}trembling...{1}{9}{4}But I'm trembling with{3}anticipation!{3}Go get 'em, {17}{1}!{2}
If I weren't so tired, I'd{3}beat down those monsters{3}without breaking a sweat!{2}
Curses! I want to smack{3}that monster with my oar.{1}...But if my oar breaks,{3}I won't be able to row...{2}
Who is that thing{3}going to grab next?{2}
If you don't do a better{3}job protecting us, there{3}won't be any oarsmen left!{2}
Why aren't you doing{3}anything to stop that{3}monster?{2}
If we lose any more{3}oarsmen, it will slow{3}the ship.{2}
We don't even know if{3}attacking the beasts will{3}do any good.{2}
If the sea monsters get{3}us, we won't be able to{3}keep rowing.{2}
I'm scared. Those sea{3}monsters are{3}terrifying.{5} {9}{4}Mommy!{2}
Fighting sea monsters is{3}for warriors. I want{3}nothing to do with it!{2}
The sea monsters are so{3}tough, a blow from an oar{3}wouldn't leave a mark.{2}
I don't care who else the{3}monster gets...{3}Just save me!{2}
Please! Just stay here{3}and protect me!{2}
{9}{4}We're surrounded by{3}danger on all sides, but{3}they still make us row!{1}Please! Finish these vile{3}beasts off!{2}
{9}{4}Ahhhh! Sea monsters!{3}Real, live sea monsters!{1}I thought I'd seen every{3}type of monster there is,{3}but this one's new to me!{2}
{9}{4}Wha{24}{5} Hey, you! This is{3}no time to start a{3}conversation!{2}
{9}{4}Aah! {5} I have to row this{3}ship because of you!{1}And now a sea monster{3}is going to eat me!{2}
{9}{4}H{5}-Hey, {17}{1}, shouldn't{3}you be moving a{3}bit faster?{2}
{9}{4}Yaaahhh! I-I'm not afraid{3}of monsters one bit!{1}But I'm just an oarsman,{3}now, not a warrior!{2}
{9}{4}The oarsmen are in dire{3}straights! Stomp and kick{3}those monsters!{2}
{9}{4}I{5}-I can't do this! Fighting{3}off sea monsters isn't{3}in my job description!{2}
{9}{4}I don't care what happens{3}now. I just want to quit{3}rowing.{2}
Sea monsters are{3}terribly ferocious!{2}
If I were a warrior,{3}I wouldn't let a monster{3}like this take over!{2}
I wonder if this warrior{3}has enough confidence to{3}defeat a monster.{2}
We're sure in a fix.{3}Say, you're going to row{3}next, aren't you?{2}
I'm so out of my wits,{3}I don't even know how{3}frightened I am.{2}
These sea monsters look{3}awfully strong!{1}I'd rather be an{3}oarsman than have{3}to fight them!{2}
Please, oh please, let{3}me make it out{3}of this alive!{2}
Why did sea monsters{3}have to appear just when{3}I get on board?{2}
I'd rather be eaten by{3}a sea monster than have{3}to row this ship.{2}
Hey, are you OK?{2}
Looks like you took care{3}of those sea monsters.{2}
We're missing an oarsman!{2}
Oh no!{5} He's unconscious!{2}
It looks like the sea{3}monsters got one{3}of our rowers...{2}
There's no way{3}around it...{1}{17}{1}{5}, go ask one of{3}the passengers to row,{3}OK?{30}
Hop to it!{2}
Look, I know you don't{3}want to have to do this,{3}but you promised...{2}
Now, bring a passenger{3}who can help row.{2}
You must feel awfully{3}important, ordering people{3}around like this!{1}I have a job to do.{3}I can't row!{2}
{9}{4}Nooooo!{5}{7} You're not going{3}to make me row, are you?{30}
I've never done much{3}physical labor, but if I{3}must{5}, then I guess I must.{2}
I'm just a businessman.{3}I'm not strong enough{3}to be of any use.{2}
You...{5} You must be joking.{3}You want me to row?{30}
You jerk! What do you{3}have against me?{2}
Ye{5}-Yeah. Besides, a{3}spatula suits me{3}better than an oar.{2}
Don't tell me{5} you're going{3}to ask a lady to row?{30}
What?{5} I don't believe this.{5}{3}You're evil! A monster!{3}I won't forget this!{2}
You startled me, sir.{3}Don't frighten me{3}like that!{2}
What? {9}{4}Ohhhh, noooo...{5}{3}{7}Are you going to{3}make me row?{30}
Huh?{5} You DO want me{3}to row?{1}Okay, okay. I'm going{3}already. But I'm not gonna{3}forget this! You...{2}
What?{5} You're not going{3}to pick me? You really{3}are a nice guy!{2}
Ha ha ha. Rowing, right?{3}Feel free to choose{3}whomever you like.{2}
What?{5} Me? You must be{3}joking! Really?{30}
{9}{4}Awwwww!{5}{7} Oh, this is{3}just too much to{3}handle.{2}
Phew! Don't frighten me{3}like that!{2}
Hey!{5} You're not thinking{3}of making me an oarsman,{3}are you?{30}
Grrr...{5} I can't believe{3}this guy is actually{3}choosing me.{1}Assigning such menial work{3}to a proud person like{3}me is going too far!{2}
Heh-heh!{5} Not picking{3}me is a smart choice,{3}buddy.{2}
What?{5} Me? An oarsman?{3}Give me a break!{3}Seriously?{30}
Oh, you are serious...{3}Fine! I'll do it...{2}
Hahhh... {5}You scared me so{3}bad, my heart nearly{3}stopped!{2}
That poor oarsman. I feel{3}so sorry for him.{1}What?{5} You want me to{3}take his place?{30}
How can you ask a young{3}lady to take his place?{3}It's not fair!!!{2}
That's right... You can't{3}ask a proper lady to{3}do such a filthy job!{2}
Out of all these people,{3}you're asking a frail old{3}man like me to row?{30}
You'll regret this when{3}I collapse from{3}exhaustion or something!{2}
Th... {5}That's right...{3}Nobody would ever{3}choose me.{2}
An oarsman was injured{3}by a sea monster?{1}I'm just glad I'm not{3}the one who has to{3}take his place!{2}
Nobody would choose me...{3}After all, I'm the tour{3}group's guide!{2}
Hey! Looks like they need{3}someone to help row...{3}Don't look over here!{2}
Rowing is a tough job,{5}{3}isn't it?{5}{3}It's not for me!{2}
Hey! This guy's been{3}staring at me the whole{3}trip... Maybe he likes me.{2}
Oh!{5} Oh, no! He's not{3}coming to ask me to{3}row, is he?{2}
Please, please... {5}{3}I'm begging! Just don't{3}let him choose me.{2}
What's with you!? Go{3}bother the men, why don't{3}you? Tsk!{2}
Why am I getting so{3}worked up over this?{1}There's no way he'd{3}choose a decrepit old man{3}like me, is there?{2}
We had enough trouble{3}just getting passengers!{1}It's not like we have{3}extra oarsmen.{2}
Looks like you've been{3}chosen to help row,{3}doesn't it?{1}So, get on with{3}the rowing!{2}
Ha ha ha!{5}{3}Chosen to be an{3}oarsman, huh?{2}
So you finally picked{3}someone, didn't you?{3}Show your stuff!{2}
It gives me chills to{3}think that could have{3}been me.{2}
Hey, {17}{1}. You've got{3}a good eye!{2}
That's who you picked{3}to be an oarsman?{1}Good choice!{3}...Looks very...oarsman{5}ly.{2}
If you've chosen an{3}oarsman, let's get{3}to rowing!{2}
You've been chosen as{3}an oarsman? Aye, now{3}that's an honor!{2}
Ho ho! Is that person{3}going to get us to Tolbi?{2}
You make me nervous{3}just standing there,{3}looking for oarsmen.{2}
I've been in a cold sweat{3}thinking they were going{3}to choose me!{2}
Oh, this poor sap looks{3}sad enough to break out{3}in tears right here!{2}
Oh, no. No...{3}When our eyes met, I{3}knew that was it.{2}
It's only natural that I{3}not be chosen.{2}
I snuck by this time...{3}But what about next time?{2}
Wow... This warrior isn't{3}gonna let anyone off easy!{3}I'm glad it's not me.{2}
You can just move{3}right along with that{3}person.{2}
Careful now, watch out...{5}{3}Don't make eye contact.{3}Turn the other way.{2}
It looks like another{3}oarsman was injured...{1}We have to pick a{3}replacement from among{3}the passengers.{2}
I feel sorry for the{3}oarsmen who were{3}injured.{1}Let's see to it that{3}no one else gets{3}hurt, OK, {17}{1}?{2}
An oarsman was injured?{2}
There's no time to worry.{3}We must escape the{3}waters of the Karagol!{2}
We have no idea when{3}those sea monsters{3}might attack again.{1}Curses! I won't let them{3}have their way with us{3}any longer!{2}
Uhnnn. When I look at{3}the water, I feel sick.{1}I wonder how long I can{3}fight in this condition...{2}
We knew the risks when{3}we set out...{1}But it always hurts{3}to see a crewman get{3}injured.{2}
{17}{1}, you're back.{2}
Hey!{5} Where's the{3}replacement for our{3}injured oarsman?{2}
What? You didn't choose{3}an oarsman?{2}
This ship won't go{3}anywhere without{3}enough oarsmen!{2}
I'm sorry, but you're{3}going to have to choose{3}someone!{2}
{17}{1}, you're back!{3}And you brought an{3}oarsman with you!{2}
Well, you're going to{3}have to row for us.{2}
All right. Take your{3}place.{2}
Now, we'll need you to{3}protect this area{3}again, {17}{1}.{2}
If we don't leave{3}soon...{2}
I wonder what's wrong...{5}{3}The ship shouldn't be{3}rocking this badly.{2}
{17}{1}!{2}
{17}{1}, up on deck!{2}
{17}{1}, there's a{3}huge sea monster on{3}the ship!{2}
If we don't do something...{3}we'll sink! You have{3}to help us!{2}
If this ship sinks,{3}everything we've done{3}will mean nothing...{1}Let's go bag us some{3}sea monsters.{2}
Imagine the size of that{3}beast!{1}Is it even possible{3}to slay such a thing?{2}
How can these sea{3}monsters keep coming one{3}after the other.{2}
Judging from Kaja's{3}reaction, it must be{3}a fearsome beast...{2}
Kaja wouldn't ask for{3}help unless it was{3}serious.{2}
The whole ship is rocking!{3}That monster must be{3}gigantic!{2}
We're okay. With you{3}here, we can handle{3}anything.{2}
If the ship sinks,{3}we're finished.{2}
That thing has Kaja and{3}his men worried. It's{3}going to be a tough fight.{2}
Monsters everywhere, and{3}I'm stuck rowing... I{3}should have stayed home!{2}
The ship is starting to{3}list... If we don't do{3}something, she'll sink!{2}
How many monsters are{3}out there?{2}
Another monster? This{3}isn't the first-class{3}passage I paid for!{2}
Owww! My hands are{3}raw from rowing.{2}
Why is he down here?{3}Shouldn't he be fighting{3}the monsters on deck?{2}
What the...? How many{3}monsters does this make?{2}
What kind of monster is{3}rocking this ship? I really{3}want to go take a look...{2}
We're running low on{3}oarsmen, and I'm{3}getting nervous.{2}
I'm taking a little break{3}until they've defeated{3}the sea monsters.{2}
Good thing we have{3}some strong fighters{3}on this ship.{2}
I wonder if the monster{3}is big enough to sink{3}the ship.{2}
I don't care what it{3}takes, just hurry up{3}and slay that beast!{2}
If those monsters come{3}back...go teach{3}'em another lesson!{2}
The boat's rocking so{3}much. I'm certain{3}we're doomed!{2}
I had no idea there were{3}so many monsters out{3}at sea...{2}
We're surrounded by{3}monsters, and still there's{3}no sign of land!{2}
I wonder if they'll make{3}us row again once they've{3}taken care of that beast.{2}
Thank you, {17}{1}.{3}You did good against{3}that Kraken.{2}
We lost another{3}oarsman, though.{2}
I need to check the hull.{3}Go find someone to{3}row the ship.{2}
Land ho!{2}
Hey,{5} I can see land!{2}
It looks like we made it!{2}
We made it?{5} Finally!{3}We're lucky to be alive{3}after all those attacks!{2}
The other passengers have{3}already disembarked...{3}Didn't even say good-bye.{2}
We don't have to row{3}anymore? Oh, what a{3}relief!{2}
Ohhh! I haven't had a{3}workout like that in{3}years!{2}
Rowing the ship was more{3}fun than I expected!{3}I'm pretty buff now!{2}
I totally lost out... An{3}ocean cruise, and I didn't{3}get to enjoy the view!{2}
You make an old man{3}row the ship, then you{3}try to beat him onshore?{1}That's pretty pathetic.{2}
Thanks for all{3}your hard work.{2}
Your efforts got this{3}ship to shore.{2}
I thank you again.{2}
Hurry, everyone! Colosso{3}is already underway{3}in Tolbi!{2}
You'd better get moving{3}to Tolbi, too.{2}
I don't think anyone{3}will be crossing the{3}Karagol for a while...{1}The oarsmen won't work{3}for us anymore.{2}
You folks really{3}fought well.{2}
A lot of oarsmen were{3}injured on this{3}voyage.{1}Nobody's going to want to{3}row until things calm{3}down in the Karagol Sea.{2}
Are we safe? It's all{3}because you defeated{3}those monsters!{2}
I've been an oarsman all{3}my life, but this last job{3}was the worst ever!{2}
You go on ahead. Just{3}when it looked like{3}everything was all right,{1}my back went out, and{3}now I can't move.{2}
We can't find anyone to{3}replace our old oarsmen.{2}
I'm just glad the Kraken{3}didn't hurt me.{2}
Sure, the pay's good, but{3}it doesn't mean a thing if{3}you get hurt on the job.{2}
{17}{1} and his pals{3}we're so daring,{3}fighting back there.{2}
I feel better now. I was{3}just so scared when I{3}was rowing.{2}
I'm in no rush, anyway...{3}This might be the last{3}time I get on a ship.{2}
You lookin' for Sean and{3}Ouranos? They left for{3}Tolbi with that tour.{1}I figure they're headed{3}for Colosso.{2}
Are you headed for{3}Colosso, too?{30}
I thought so. Most people{3}coming at this time of{3}year usually are.{1}There was this group of{3}six we ferried across{3}a while back.{1}Now they were strange.{2}
You came all this way,{3}and you're not going{3}to Colosso?{1}That old guy's group,{3}those six weirdos, and{3}now you...{1}You guys are strange!{2}
This group that came on{3}our last voyage pulled{3}some strange stunts.{1}Actually, I was sorta{3}spying on them.{2}
I want Sean and Ouranos{3}to do well at Colosso{3}this year,{1}but they don't stand a{3}chance if {17}{1}{3}enters the contest.{2}
I'm just going to hang out{3}in Tolbi and enjoy myself{3}for a while.{2}
I wonder what happened{3}to that strange group{3}that went on to Tolbi.{2}
When the waters are this{3}dangerous, you just can't{3}take to the seas.{1}I think I'll check out{3}Colosso while we think{3}about what to do next.{2}
See? Our ship survived{3}an attack and crossed{3}the sea safely.{1}It just proves how{3}effective that lucky{3}anchor really is!{2}
I hear you had a scary{3}trip. You even got{3}attacked by a monster!{30}
I wonder why the sea is{3}so dangerous all of{3}a sudden...{2}
And you fought off all{3}those monsters alone?{3}...No way!{1}Everyone knows that Kaja{3}was the one who killed{3}the Kraken!{2}
Sigh...{5} I think we're{3}done sailing for a while.{1}We've already lost one{3}ship... What else can{3}we do?{2}
I guess we won't be{3}seeing anyone back home{3}in Angara for a while.{2}
I think that missing ship{3}must have run into the{3}Kraken...{2}
I'm sorry, but we just{3}can't sell any tickets{3}right now.{1}The sea is too dangerous,{3}so we've had to cancel{3}all crossings.{2}
We rented out our house{3}for Colosso, and now the{3}ship's not launching!{1}If the ship isn't crossing,{3}we can't take our trip!{2}
We rented out our house.{3}If the ship won't sail,{3}where will we sleep?{2}
Sigh. We could have made{3}lots of money on those{3}tickets. Bad luck, I guess.{2}
Maybe we'll stay here{3}until the ship leaves.{2}
Are we supposed to{3}sleep on the floor until{3}they set sail again?{2}
The tourists look a{3}little upset. Did they{3}get seasick?{30}
The sea was calm, but{3}that monster sure gave{3}them a rough ride.{2}
The ship was attacked by{3}monsters? It came within{3}inches of sinking? Wow!{2}
Silk Road was blocked,{3}so I thought my parents{3}might come by ship.{1}I don't see them{3}anywhere, though...{2}
What's that?{5} You have{3}a message for me from{3}my parents?{30}
Oh, they couldn't make{3}it because the tickets{3}were too expensive?{1}Thank you for letting{3}me know!{2}
Oh... I hope nothing{3}awful's happened to{3}them...{2}
Thank you for giving{3}me the message{3}from my parents.{2}
If you're going to Tolbi,{3}keep heading west.{3}It's not too far.{2}
It's been quite some time{3}since the Colosso Tour{3}passengers left for Tolbi.{2}
After seeing the looks on{3}the passengers' faces,{1}I don't feel like{3}waiting for my ship{3}anymore.{2}
It was a hard crossing...{3}Very risky. I'm glad{3}they didn't come...{2}
I get the feeling that it{3}will be a long time before{3}the next sea crossing.{2}
You crossed the sea just{3}for Colosso? ...That was{3}a big undertaking!{2}
Hmm... {5} So we've finally{3}reached Tolbi, huh?{2}
Umm... No.{1}That doesn't look like{3}Tolbi's coast.{2}
We must be off course.{3}I don't recognize this{3}place.{2}
You're right...{3}That looks like an island.{2}
Hmm... Maybe we should{3}stop for a minute.{2}
We need time to check{3}the ship's position...{1}Let's head for that{3}island and get our{3}bearings.{2}
We've reached the island!{5}{3}Rowers, rest those{3}weary arms!{2}
Island? Isn't this{3}Tolbi?{2}
What do you mean, island?{3}Aren't we in Tolbi?{2}
Uh... Tolbi's not an island,{3}is it?{2}
The ship went off course,{3}and we're... Well, we're{3}not sure where we are.{1}We've come to this{3}island so we can get our{3}bearings.{2}
Raise your oars and rest{3}for a little while.{2}
I'm going to check on{3}the other passengers.{2}
If the ship isn't going{3}anywhere, I'm not{3}waiting down here.{1}Let's take a break{3}out front.{2}
If I'm not rowing,{3}I ain't staying here.{1}I'm gonna go take{3}my break out front.{2}
As long as we're stopping,{3}I don't have to stay{3}in here.{1}It's time for my break.{2}
I've been sailing for{3}many years, and I've{3}never seen this island!{2}
Wow!{5} I have a blister{3}on my drumming hand...{2}
I wonder if it's okay to{3}leave the ship here...{2}
Stopping again and again{3}like this is harder than{3}rowing all day long.{2}
Let's see, islands in{3}the Karagol Sea...{5}{5}{3}Hmmm...just thinking.{2}
When we're rowing, we{3}can just sit and{3}space out, but...{1}It makes me nervous,{3}just sitting here{3}and not rowing.{2}
It's crazy to have{3}inexperienced passengers{3}rowing the ship.{2}
It was hard for me all{3}the way across the sea.{2}
I sure hope another{3}monster doesn't attack...{2}
Looks like I'm going to{3}have sore muscles for the{3}first time in a while...{2}
Could this be that island{5}{3}that's rumored to have{3}buried treasure?{1}Even if it is, I'm too{3}scared of monsters to{3}leave the ship.{2}
Maybe it's time for{3}me to retire...{2}
You can't go onto the{3}island! It's too dangerous!{1}What if there are{3}monsters?{2}
But there were monsters{3}at sea, so shouldn't it{3}be safer on land?{2}
We've been cooped up{3}on that ship too long.{1}We're near land, so let{3}us stretch our legs!{2}
There could be monsters{3}here, so leaving the{3}ship might be dangerous.{2}
The ship keeps shaking...{3}She can't take much more!{1}I want to plant my feet{3}firmly on land!{2}
Why should we have to{3}wait on this tiny boat?{2}
If there are monsters,{3}I'm not going anywhere.{2}
I don't hear the{3}passengers screaming to{3}get off the boat.{2}
I don't feel so well..{3}Don't talk to me...{2}
I hate arguing...{2}
What to do...{3}I'm worried about the{3}passenger's safety,{2}
but why should we stay{3}onboard when there's land{3}right in front of us?{2}
I'm sick of this ship...{3}I'm going ashore.{2}
Land monsters, I can{3}handle; sea monsters are{3}all slimy and icky...{2}
I've been wobbling on{3}this boat for so long I{3}can hardly stand!{2}
Go ahead, try and stop{3}me! I'm going ashore!!!{2}
Just don't make me face{3}that disgusting Kraken{3}again...{2}
So...anyone know if{3}there are any monsters{3}out there?{2}
Ohh, that's creepy...{2}
In a perfect world, there{3}wouldn't be any monsters{3}waiting to pounce on me...{2}
{16}, don't talk{3}like that.{5} Shouldn't we{3}listen to them?{30}
Kaja and the captain are{3}professionals.{1}We ought to trust them{3}and wait, like they said.{2}
{17}{1}, you talked{3}to the passengers,{3}didn't you?{1}The tour group is arguing{3}about whether they should{3}leave the ship.{2}
We'd like to go ashore{3}and see if it's safe{3}out there...{1}But we promised we'd{3}protect the ship.{2}
...That's it! {5} {17}{1}!{1}Can you go check out the{3}island and see if there{3}are any monsters?{30}
The passengers all seem{3}to be upset, so let's try{3}to do as they ask.{2}
That's right. We have to{3}do something, or there'll{3}be no resolving this.{2}
It would be fun to{3}explore the island!{3}What do you say, {17}{1}?{30}
I see, you're going to go{3}for me, aren't you?{1}I'm sure no one will{3}complain if we scout out{3}the island.{2}
There's no telling what{3}kind of monsters are{3}lurking on this island...{1}Be extremely careful!{2}
We've done a good job{3}of keeping the ship{3}safe so far!{1}{17}{1}, you can{3}leave everything to us{3}while you're away.{2}
I want to be a sailor{3}like Kaja, reading the{3}wind and the waves...{2}
I give up! What are{3}we supposed to do?{2}
That's enough bickering...{2}
This island gives me the{3}creeps...{2}
What we can do now{3}is to protect this ship...{2}
Be careful{24}there{3}could be monsters{3}anywhere around here.{2}
You'd be surprised, the{3}kinds of treasure you can{3}find on islands like these.{2}
We may have taken the{3}wrong route, but we've{3}made a lot of progress.{2}
We're looking into the{3}ship's position. It'll be{3}a bit longer.{2}
I'm really surprised that{3}there is an island like{3}this in the Karagol Sea.{2}
The wind's direction and{3}the high seas... We've{3}got to be close to Tolbi.{2}
How was it, {17}{1}?{5}{3}Did you explore the{3}island thoroughly?{30}
If we don't decide if we{3}can go ashore, they'll{3}never stop whining.{1}...I hate to ask you, but{3}would you go exploring{3}one more time?{2}
Well...{5} Did you see any{3}monsters out there?{30}
...I see.{5} Then we can't{3}let the tourists go{3}ashore after all?{2}
If there aren't any{3}monsters,{5} I guess we can{3}let the tourists out!{2}
The passengers are going{3}stir crazy! They're out{3}of control!{1}You're going to have{3}to let the passengers{3}go ashore.{2}
There's no need for that.{2}
We figured out the{3}course to Tolbi.{2}
Really? We can go?{2}
Let's go to Tolbi before{3}the sea gets any rougher.{1}Tell our tourists they{3}can enjoy a nice, long{3}break after we arrive.{2}
It's too late...{3}Nothing we can say will{3}calm them down.{2}
If we hurry, we can make{3}it to Colosso in time.{2}
I see!{5} If we can get{3}them to Colosso, they'll{3}all be happy.{2}
All right then, go and{3}tell the tourists.{2}
It's not much farther.{3}I'll ask the oarsmen to{3}work 'til the very end.{2}
Sorry, everyone{5}, but{3}we need to switch the{3}left and right teams!{1}We've strayed off{3}course because the left{3}team's timing is off.{2}
One last push should{3}get us there. Give it{3}all you've got, people!{2}
All right!{5} Let's aim for{3}Tolbi and set off one{3}last time!{2}
I'm spreading goodwill{3}wherever I travel.{2}
Even though I'm opposed{3}to violence, I'm looking{3}forward to Colosso.{2}
The ship's crew is ready{3}for anything, and I'll{3}be right here for them.{1}Ask the others to do{3}the rowing.{2}
I can't row, but I am{3}hoping for the ship's{3}safe arrival.{2}
The ship's crew is ready{3}for anything, and I'll{3}be right here for them.{1}Ask the others to do{3}the rowing.{2}
Is this cruel ordeal{3}part of some plan fate{3}has in store for me?{2}
It is good that the ship{3}has arrived safely.{2}
We made it to Colosso{3}in time... That's good.{2}
The ship won't be leaving{3}here... There are too{3}many monsters at sea.{1}This ship isn't going{3}anywhere for a while.{2}
Ahhh. I'm bored...{5} When{3}are we going out{3}to sea again?{2}
The ship hasn't returned,{3}so we couldn't set off{3}even if we wanted to.{2}
Oh ho ho! Without a ship,{3}we can't do any business...{2}
I'm glad I only work on{3}the docks...but I am{3}worried about the others.{2}
I wonder if monsters{3}got everyone.{2}
Incredible! So this is the{3}ocean Kraden was talking{3}about!{2}
The Karagol is surrounded{3}by land,{5} so technically,{3}it's not a real ocean.{1}A true ocean is{3}totally open.{2}
What? But this looks{3}just the way Kraden{3}described it!{2}
Someday, I want{3}to see a real{3}ocean, {17}{1}!{2}
Tolbi's always really{3}bustling during Colosso.{1}This festival only happens{3}once a year, so I'm{3}really excited.{2}
Colosso is held in the{3}colosseum in the heart{3}of Tolbi.{1}If we don't go right now,{3}we won't get good seats!{3}That won't be any fun!{2}
Tryouts started at the{3}colosseum today.{1}I'm planning to go{3}watch the finals.{2}
Colosso should have{3}started today. What{3}on earth is going on?{1}I saw Babi's bodyguards{3}wandering around.{1}What if something's{3}happened to our leader?{2}
Babi was already pretty{3}old back about the time{3}I was born.{1}I'm 65 years old now,{3}so just imagine how old{3}Babi must be!{2}
Can someone live to be{3}more than 100 years old?{30}
Hmmm. Still, I'm pretty{3}sure Babi is a lot{3}older than 100...{2}
You could be right. But{3}then, what about Tolbi's{3}ruler, Babi?{1}He's supposedly at least{3}50 years older than I am!{2}
Whee! It's a festival!{3}It's the Colosso Festival!{1}What'll I buy with all{3}the money Mama gave{3}me? I can't decide!{2}
Waah! She said that money{3}was for both of us!{2}
Get your Colosso{3}souvenirs! They make{3}great gifts!{2}
Get your snacks and{3}drinks before you get{3}in the colosseum!{2}
I've decided not to fight{3}at Colosso after all.{1}Have you seen the{3}contestants? They're{3}HUGE!{2}
Wow, Tolbi's festival is{3}humongous! Just seeing all{3}this is so exciting!{2}
Rats! We overslept, and{3}now the colosseum is{3}full!{1}There's nothing we can{3}do, so we've just been{3}wandering around Tolbi.{2}
Yeah. That dice game{3}looks kinda fun.{1}If you can enjoy playing{3}a game AND win prizes,{3}why not give it a try?{2}
Children really do love{3}souvenirs, don't they?{30}
I'll bet you like them, too.{3}Don't try to hide it! I{3}used to love souvenirs...{1}But the wife doesn't{3}go in for that sort{3}of thing.{2}
Hmph! You're only saying{3}that because your parents{3}never bought you any!{2}
Be patient, little guy.{2}
I'll buy you better{3}sweets than those{3}later on.{2}
{9}{4}Waah!{7} Buy me some{3}sweets! I said buy me{3}some sweets!{2}
The inns are all full, so{3}I'm staying here.{1}This archway keeps the{3}rain off of me, so{3}it's as good as any inn.{2}
Tourists aren't the{3}only ones who love{3}Colosso! It's the best!{2}
The trials are starting at{3}the colosseum today.{1}If you win there, you{3}advance to the finals.{2}
The trials are okay, but{3}the finals are the real{3}fun at Colosso.{2}
It's not like there have{3}been any problems{3}lately...{1}I wonder what's{3}happened to set Babi's{3}soldiers in motion.{2}
Every year, I get older{3}and older, while Babi{3}just stays the same.{2}
What if Babi is actually{3}a totally different{3}person now,{1}and we just don't{3}know it?{2}
I'm the oldest, so I{3}shouldn't have to{3}share my allowance.{2}
Mama told us to share{3}the money. Doesn't{3}my brother remember?{2}
We have to sell all of{3}these Colosso souvenirs{3}before Colosso ends.{2}
They're selling these at{3}the colosseum, too, but{3}they're cheaper here!{2}
I saw the people who are{3}going to fight. They look{3}so intimidating!{2}
Tolbi is not like Xian.{3}It is very lively here!{2}
I can't say anything,{3}'cause it sounds bad,{1}but I suddenly got too{3}scared to watch Colosso,{3}so I overslept on purpose!{2}
I like playing Lucky Dice,{3}but if I'm not careful,{3}I'll spend all my money!{2}
The stuff they're selling{3}at the stalls along the{3}street looks so tasty!{1}If my kids buy some, I'd{3}be able to eat too.{2}
Why do kids want such{3}awful stuff?{1}I'm not ever buying you{3}that! No matter what!{2}
Those sweets smell great.{3}I'm not moving until{3}you buy me some.{2}
I've been guarding our{3}spot, but it's not{3}really worth it.{1}I wonder if my friends{3}will get here soon...{2}
Hey, have you seen anyone{3}who looks like this?{30}
Babi must be nearby!!!{2}
Where's Babi!? He{3}doesn't seem to be here.{3}Let's look over there.{2}
Missing Person
Tolbi is packed with{3}tourists during Colosso,{3}so the inns are all full.{1}Me, I just line up some{3}beds, and presto!{3}I'm an innkeeper!{2}
Do you want to{3}stay with us?{30}
Actually, I'm sorry, but{3}we're already full, and I{3}don't have room for you.{2}
That's good... Our place{3}is already full, anyway.{2}
I couldn't sleep at all last{3}night. The guy next to me{3}snored the whole time!{1}I'm so tired... I'm just{3}not ready for Colosso!{2}
The crowds at the{3}colosseum made me feel{3}sick, so I came back!{2}
Once Colosso starts,{3}we're going to make so{3}much money. I love this.{2}
It's too late to start{3}looking now. They'll never{3}find a place to stay!{1}People fighting at Colosso{3}all stay at Babi's Palace.{2}
If I could have slept last{3}night, I would have had a{3}great time at Colosso.{2}
Huh-uh. Crowds are a{3}definite no-no.{1}Say, why wasn't Tolbi's{3}ruler{24}Babi, or whatever{3}his name is{24}there?{2}
We paid good money to{3}rent this house during the{3}festival, so get out!{2}
We get to stay here until{3}the owners come back.{2}
I really want to see{3}Colosso, too!{1}But the colosseum gets{3}too crowded, so I'm just{3}going to watch the finals.{2}
Wahhh! I want to see{3}Colosso, but no one{3}will take me!{2}
I was stubborn; I said,{3}"I'm not going to see{3}any of the tryouts!"{1}But now, I wish I'd gone.{2}
I keep on crying, but{3}Daddy still won't take{3}me to Colosso!{2}
I wonder if they really{3}can't find Babi...{1}If it is true, what{3}will happen to{3}Colosso?{2}
Babi wasn't at Colosso{3}according to all{3}the spectators...{2}
It's strange that Babi's{3}soldiers are hanging out{3}all around town.{1}Those bodyguards we saw{3}were probably looking{3}for Babi, right?{2}
It's strange... Babi loves{3}Colosso, but he's not{3}at the colosseum...{1}I wonder if what that{3}boy said is true. Could{3}Babi be missing?{2}
We're going to make some{3}money at Colosso.{1}But of course, Babi{3}always makes the most.{2}
I heard Babi is using the{3}money he made to build{3}a lighthouse in Gondowan.{1}Everyone calls it{3}Babi Lighthouse.{2}
He just takes a cut of{3}all the money we earn.{3}That's how to make money!{2}
Naming the lighthouse he{3}built after himself is{3}a little vain, you think?{2}
You look strong...{3}Go fight at Colosso!{2}
Hang on! Now that I think{3}about it, the tryouts{3}have already started!{1}So, even if I wanted to{3}fight in Colosso, it's{3}too late to sign up?{2}
I guess I never would{3}have made it to the{3}finals anyway.{2}
Is this your first{3}time to Tolbi?{30}
Tolbi offers many chances{3}to powerful warriors.{1}Colosso, especially, offers{3}them a great chance.{2}
Tolbi is a fun place,{3}no matter how many{3}times you visit!{1}You ought to go and{3}enjoy yourself at Colosso.{2}
They have some nice{3}things for sale in Tolbi,{3}so go shopping!{2}
If you can make a name{3}for yourself at{3}Colosso, you might get{1}to become one of{3}Babi's guards.{2}
Babi chooses Colosso's{3}victors to be his soldiers{3}because of their prowess.{2}
We're fully booked with{3}reservations during{3}Colosso.{1}You're going to have a{3}hard time finding a place{3}to stay now.{2}
Colosso is the busiest{3}time of year in Tolbi.{1}In fact, you should make{3}reservations now for{3}next year's Colosso.{2}
We're so busy running{3}the inn we can't go to{3}Colosso. It's so boring.{2}
A tour group came from{3}Kalay this year.{1}They only reserved two{3}rooms, but they have so{3}many people in them...{2}
We aren't going to get{3}to see any of Colosso{3}this year.{1}We have to start cooking{3}our guests' dinners first{3}thing in the morning.{2}
I'm not very interested{3}in Colosso. It's so{3}barbaric.{2}
Oh, no! We barely made it{3}to Tolbi, and now we can't{3}even enter Colosso.{1}Why did we even bother{3}coming out to Tolbi!?{2}
If we'd gotten here just{3}a little earlier, we could{3}have entered Colosso.{2}
The tour group is feeling{3}cramped in their quarters.{1}Maybe we should build a{3}bigger inn for next{3}year.{2}
We can't handle too{3}many more guests than{3}this.{2}
I'm going to go to{3}the Colosso finals,{3}no matter what!{2}
There aren't enough beds{3}for the tour group from{3}Kalay.{1}Where will they sleep?{2}
The innkeeper told me to{3}cook a gourmet meal, but{3}he's asking the impossible.{1}Just making enough food{3}for so many guests is a{3}big job unto itself.{2}
I have a headache just{3}thinking about how busy{3}these guests will make me.{2}
Even though I can't enter{3}Colosso, I stayed at the{3}inn thinking I'll go watch.{1}I've come all this way,{3}so I may as well see{3}what I can.{2}
If we could have entered{3}Colosso, victory would{3}have been ours. Sheesh!{2}
What a waste to be stuck{3}here when such a big{3}festival's going on.{2}
I wonder how the tryouts{3}are going... Hmmm,{3}it's really on my mind.{2}
Normally, no one's allowed{3}into Babi's Palace, but{3}during Colosso,{1}visitors are free{3}to enter.{2}
Some of the rooms in the{3}palace are available{3}to Colosso entrants.{1}You should be thankful{3}Lord Babi is such a{3}gracious host.{2}
Should the palace really{3}be open to the public{3}in such circumstances?{2}
I wonder how many people{3}will stay here at Babi{3}Palace after Colosso...{2}
Did you run into any of{3}Babi's soldiers in Town?{30}
That means they must not{3}have found him yet...{2}
Hmph! I told them to{3}search every nook and{3}cranny of this town...{2}
If you're entering Colosso,{3}hurry along to the{3}colosseum.{1}But even if you leave{3}now, you may be too{3}late for the trials...{2}
I wonder how diligently{3}Babi's soldiers are{3}looking for him.{2}
Warriors are not allowed{3}to stay in the palace if{3}they don't enter Colosso!{2}
We have just enough{3}extra beds in this{3}room for everybody.{1}Please follow me.{2}
You may use these four{3}beds.{1}Will you be going right{3}to sleep?{30}
Then, enjoy your rest.{2}
Well, if you do get tired,{3}feel free to sleep here{3}anytime you like.{2}
Would you like{3}to sleep now?{30}
Ohh, I'm so tired...{2}
I didn't think we'd ever{3}find a place to stay. What{3}a relief!{2}
Let's rest up{3}for tomorrow.{2}
Good night.{2}
G'night.{2}
Sleep well.{2}
Morning.{2}
Good morning.{2}
Good morning.{2}
All right, {17}{1}! We've{3}got another hard day{3}of work ahead of us!{2}
Are you planning to{3}enter Colosso?{30}
You'd better leave{3}right away, then!{1}The trials are already{3}underway. Go on to{3}the colosseum!{2}
So, did you guys get{3}injured, too?{1}Getting injured just{3}before the trials begin{3}is the worst.{2}
I can't fight because{3}of a little indigestion?{3}That's pathetic!{2}
Maybe I can shrug off{3}this pain in my gut...{3}I have to enter Colosso...{2}
It's no use! My stomach{3}really hurts!{2}
I want to watch the{3}Colosso matches, too.{1}But my job is just to{3}encourage the warriors{3}to do their best.{2}
I get so angry seeing{3}all the warriors going{3}off to fight in Colosso.{1}I hurt my back during{3}my training, and now I{3}can't move at all.{2}
Maybe I shouldn't have{3}eaten quite so much{3}yesterday...{2}
Only warriors who fight{3}well in Colosso's finals{3}can become soldiers here.{1}All the warriors enter{3}Colosso because they{3}want to join our ranks.{2}
Lord Babi is building the{3}lighthouse as a display{3}of his power.{2}
Babi's name is riding on{3}the construction of his{3}lighthouse. It's a huge{1}undertaking, which is why{3}the guard around the{3}lighthouse is so tight.{2}
Even if Lord Babi doesn't{3}return, the campaign to{3}build Babi Lighthouse{1}will go on... I won't be{3}able to relax until we{3}know where Babi is.{2}
My first Colosso was{3}so exciting!{1}I bet the battles will get{3}pretty heated this year.{2}
Once the lighthouse is{3}complete, Babi's name{3}will live forever.{2}
We'd never get near the{3}lighthouse without these{3}passes from Iodem.{2}
I hear that girl is going{3}on the next campaign.{3}What could it mean?{2}
Originally, there were{3}ancient ruins at the site{3}of Babi Lighthouse.{1}There's said to be an{3}extremely long tunnel{3}beneath those ruins.{2}
No matter how many times{3}I run the experiment,{3}I never get the results{1}I want! My Alchemy skills{3}have weakened, as Kraden{3}warned me they would.{2}
It is said that long ago,{3}the power of Alchemy{3}was sealed away.{1}But why would it have{3}been sealed away?{2}
Originally, the ancient{3}Venus Ruins lay buried{3}under Babi Lighthouse.{2}
Babi makes his scholars{3}perform all sorts of{3}research.{1}I wonder where Babi's{3}favorite scholar, Kraden,{3}is now?{2}
No one has ever reached{3}the end of the tunnel in{3}the ancient ruins...{1}I'd sure like to know{3}what's at the end of{3}that tunnel.{2}
Still, my experiments in{3}Alchemy are progressing{3}better than before.{1}Maybe Kraden's research{3}is meeting with success...{2}
Kraden's journey was{3}meant to revive the lost{3}art of Alchemy.{1}We hope, of course, that{3}he can explain why it had{3}been sealed away, too.{2}
The Venus Ruins are the{3}remnants of a magnificent{3}ancient civilization.{1}The lighthouse is being{3}built on the foundation{3}of the Venus Ruins.{2}
Lord Babi expected{3}great results from{3}Kraden's journey.{1}I wonder what he{3}expected Kraden to learn{3}from that research.{2}
Iodem, Iodem!{2}
We went to Altmiller{3}Cave, as you commanded.{2}
And what have you?{3}What news is there{3}of Babi?{2}
{5}This is futile...{2}
Iodem, why did you send{3}us to look for Babi in a{3}place like that?{2}
Why would Lord Babi{3}enter such a dangerous{3}cave alone? It's...{2}
Inconceivable?{3}Is that what you were{3}going to say?{2}
Altmiller Cave is an{3}evil place.{2}
If Babi went there alone,{3}a monster might have...{2}
I'm aware of Altmiller{3}Cave's.{5}.{5}.{5}eccentricities.{2}
You knew? Then why{3}would you send us{3}in there, Iodem?{2}
Lord Babi has left in{3}secret before...{2}
You mean, this isn't the{3}first time Lord Babi has{3}disappeared, Iodem?{2}
Do you know where{3}he went before?{2}
I followed Lord{3}Babi once...{2}
I was certain he had{3}gone into Altmiller{3}Cave...{2}
Did you ever investigate{3}the cave, Iodem?{2}
What was he doing{3}in the cave?{2}
Once he entered the cave,{3}Lord Babi vanished{5}{3}before my very eyes.{2}
Vanished?{2}
You mean you lost sight{3}of Lord Babi. Is that it?{2}
After he entered the{3}mouth of the cave,{3}I followed him...{1}but he had vanished,{3}leaving no trace.{2}
I tried following him{3}several times after that.{1}Each time, he vanished{3}within seconds of entering{3}the cave's mouth.{2}
And you think that's{3}where Lord Babi went{3}this morning, Iodem?{2}
But if he always{3}returned from Altmiller{3}Cave before...{2}
Then he should be{3}back soon, right?{2}
No. This time is{3}different. Something{3}puzzles me...{2}
What do you mean?{2}
It is certainly strange{3}that Lord Babi should go{3}right before Colosso.{1}But there's something{3}else...{2}
What is it?{2}
Lord Babi's bedding was{3}not disturbed this{3}morning.{2}
What's unusual{3}about that?{2}
Last night, Lord Babi did{3}not use his bed.{3}That is the problem.{2}
Lord Babi has, in fact,{3}been missing since{3}last night.{2}
And that is why I am{3}so worried. He has{3}never done this before.{2}
We didn't know he'd been{3}missing so long...{2}
You don't think Lord{3}Babi's been ki{24}{2}
Speak no such foolishness!{3}I am sure Lord Babi is{3}alive and well somewhere!{2}
Ah, yes, of course.{2}
I will go to the colosseum{3}in Lord Babi's stead.{3}You must find him...{2}
We will all conduct{3}another round of{3}searches.{2}
Lord Babi, where{3}have you gone?{2}
It looks like Lord Babi{3}didn't use his bed{3}this morning.{1}What does it mean?{2}
I guess Lord Babi did{3}not go to sleep{3}last night.{2}
{17}{7} has been staying{3}as Lord Babi's guest{3}for some time.{1}She comes from the{3}town of Lalivero, on the{3}Gondowan continent.{2}
{17}{7} was revered{3}as a child of the gods{3}in her hometown...{1}But she looks like an{3}average child to me.{2}
Babi is holding me hostage{3}in order to complete his{3}lighthouse in Lalivero.{1}When shall I ever be{3}able to return to my{3}homeland?{2}
{17}{7} was taken hostage{3}to force the Laliverans{3}to build Babi Lighthouse.{1}It is heartbreaking to see{3}her tears and hear her{3}pleas to be released.{2}
{17}{7} is not permitted{3}to leave this room. Child{3}of the gods or not,{1}I do not think she{3}could make it to{3}Gondowan alone.{2}
Even if I escaped Babi{3}Palace, my power could{3}not get me to Lalivero.{1}It would be impossible{3}for me to make it through{3}the deadly Suhalla alone.{2}
Did you just...{2}
No, it is nothing.{2}
They're holding the{3}preliminary Colosso{3}heats right now.{1}The winners of the{3}trials will advance{3}to the finals.{2}
Sigh... The colosseum is{3}packed with people. I'll{3}never get in there.{2}
Are you hoping to get{3}in to see Colosso now?{30}
First-timers all make{3}that mistake.{1}If you want to see{3}Colosso, you have to get{3}to the colosseum early.{2}
Good choice... If you want{3}in, you should come back{3}early tomorrow morning.{2}
If you hit it big in the{3}Lucky Guess, you can win{3}a pretty penny.{1}You have to watch the{3}trials closely to decide{3}who you'll root for.{2}
I've been betting on the{3}Lucky Guess for many{3}years, but I've never won.{1}I'd like to hit it big{3}just once in my life.{2}
Colosso's Lucky Guess{3}makes the battles in{3}the colosseum better.{2}
I want to win big, so I{3}put it all on a warrior{3}no one else has picked.{2}
Do you know what the{3}Lucky Guess is?{30}
Entrants can't pick their{3}own team members.{1}That way, the matches{3}won't be fixed.{2}
It's a game where you try{3}to guess which warrior{3}will win the finals.{1}If you hit it right,{3}you can win fabulous{3}prizes.{2}
I wonder which warrior{3}will be the one to{3}advance to the finals?{1}Oh, I can't wait!{2}
Having to arrive so early{3}just to get into the{3}colosseum is awful.{2}
There are so many people{3}who arrive late and{3}can't get in.{1}I suppose everyone{3}will come here early{3}tomorrow.{2}
I'm going to pick the{3}biggest, strongest{3}warrior to win.{2}
I'm feeling confident{3}this time. I'm sure I'll{3}get it!{2}
Everyone keeps risking{3}more and more, so the{3}prize is huge!{1}If a warrior that few{3}people picked wins,{3}they'll win big!{2}
Every year, I go after a{3}big win, knowing that{3}it's a mistake.{1}This is the one vice{3}I can't give up.{2}
Once the trials are over,{3}it's going to get busy,{3}just like every year.{2}
Go for it! That's it!{3}I'm cheering for you,{3}little guy!{2}
Watching the trials makes{3}me really excited. The{3}battles are incredible!{2}
Watching such proud,{3}skilled warriors in{3}battle is so enchanting.{2}
I've waited a whole year{3}to see Colosso. I can't{3}wait for the finals!{2}
!!!{2}
You have to make it{3}through countless matches{3}to reach the finals.{1}That warrior failed{3}his trial, so he's{3}disqualified here.{2}
You have to perfect{3}techniques like those{3}to reach the finals.{1}That warrior cleared{3}this trial, but I doubt{3}he'll make the finals.{2}
Even the smaller warriors{3}can win if they have{3}enough spirit!{2}
These trials are based{3}on personal challenges.{3}I get excited watching.{2}
What fantastic physiques!{3}Why, if I were{3}younger...{2}
I didn't think the battles{3}in the trials would be{3}so fierce...{1}I can't even imagine{3}what kind of battles{3}the finals will have!{2}
No matter how good a{3}warrior is, there's always{3}someone who's better.{2}
{17}{1} checked the sign.{1}Inn Full{3}No Vacancies{2}
This is stage {22}{3}of the first finals{3}match.{2}
This is stage {22}{3}of the first finals{3}match.{2}
This is stage {22}{3}of the second finals{3}match.{2}
This is stage {22}{3}of the second finals{3}match.{2}
This is stage {22}{3}of the third finals{3}match.{2}
This is stage {22}{3}of the third finals{3}match.{2}
Would you like to hear{3}a description of this{3}stage?{30}
Would you like a friend{3}to cheer for you here?{30}
If you know who you want{3}to cheer you on,{3}please let me know!{2}
{18}{1} will cheer{3}for you? This way,{3}please.{2}
Descriptions
Cheer
Nothing
All right, do your best!{2}
Unfortunately, we have a{3}full house. Please cheer{3}somewhere else.{2}
The match is about to{3}begin. Please take your{3}places.{2}
Huh? Are you done{3}cheering?{30}
Then please wait here{3}until the match begins.{2}
Then cheer as best{3}you can!{2}
Yeah
Nope
The objective in this{3}stage is to clear a path{3}as quickly as you can.{2}
They call this the{3}Rock Challenge.{2}
Warriors must create{3}steps they can use{3}to get through here.{2}
Warriors must use only{3}the objects in this stage,{3}along with their own{1}strength and wit, to{3}reach the next stage.{2}
The objective here is to{3}make good use of the{3}scales.{2}
This area is called the{3}Pipeworks.{2}
See the water pipes?{3}They actually form a{3}kind of scale.{2}
When one side lowers,{3}the other side rises.{2}
Using this premise, you{3}must find a way to{3}reach the next stage.{2}
The operator of the{3}bridge will also cheer{3}for you in this stage.{2}
They call this the{3}Broken Bridge.{2}
Carefully time your{3}bridge crossings to{3}reach the next stage.{2}
If your timing is off,{3}you'll fall down, which{3}will cost you time.{2}
The logs are the key{3}to clearing this stage.{2}
This place is normally{3}called the Lumber{3}Water Crossing Area.{2}
The obstacle at this stage{3}is that large water tank.{2}
If you can get all the{3}way across in one go,{3}you don't have to{1}give it that much{3}thought.{2}
But if you want to reach{3}the treasure box, it'll{3}take a little planning.{2}
The main thing with this{3}stage is to proceed{3}through the maze...{1}without panicking{3}or getting lost.{2}
This stage is dubbed{3}the Mini-Maze.{2}
The rules are simple:{3}get through the maze{3}as quickly as you can.{2}
But you'll have to think{3}on your feet and act{3}quickly to win.{2}
The operator of the{3}lifts will cheer for{3}you here.{2}
This is the shifting{3}floor stage.{2}
Step skillfully across{3}the floor as it moves{3}around.{2}
If you don't time your{3}steps right, you'll lose{3}valuable time.{2}
Here, your objective is{3}to ride the logs as{3}quickly as possible.{2}
This is the Log-{3}Rolling Stage.{2}
Ride the logs across{3}the water to get to{3}the other side.{2}
Try to reach the opposite{3}shore and head for the{3}next stage.{2}
Scaling the wall quickly{3}is priority one in{3}this stage.{2}
The fans just call this{3}The Wall.{2}
Scale the wall first,{3}then get your nerve{3}up and jump!{2}
Look for spots where you{3}can drop off the{3}wall quickly.{2}
Your focus here will be{3}rolling the logs to{3}form a path.{2}
This place is called{3}the Board Walk.{2}
The logs here are{3}positioned to{3}block your path.{2}
Roll those logs to open{3}a path and follow{3}it to the next stage.{2}
Here your objective is to{3}get across the gaps{3}as quickly as you can.{2}
This stage is called{3}the Scales of{3}Justice.{2}
There are two ledges{3}that actually form{3}a scale.{2}
When one ledge rises,{3}the other falls.{2}
Use the scales to{3}cross the gaps and{3}race to the next stage.{2}
Your goal in this stage{3}is simple: find the{3}shortest path.{2}
This is the Stepping-{3}Stone Stage.{2}
You can reach the next{3}stage by jumping from{3}stone to stone.{2}
Study the placement of{3}the stones, then choose{3}the shortest path.{2}
The operator of the{3}walls will cheer for{3}you on this stage.{2}
This place is called{3}the Wall Wedge.{2}
The pistons move back and{3}forth. Avoid them to{1}reach the next stage.{2}
If your timing is off,{3}a piston might knock you{3}off the ledge.{2}
To clear this stage, you{3}must be able to change{3}directions while climbing.{2}
This place is normally{3}called the Free-{3}Climb Area.{2}
This sheer wall has{3}a bumpy surface.{2}
Using those bumps, feel{3}your way up the wall and{3}climb to the next stage.{2}
In this stage, you must{3}try to outpace the{3}conveyor belt.{2}
This is called the Moving{3}Sidewalk Stage.{2}
The conveyor belt moves{3}opposite the direction{3}you need to go.{2}
Race against it to{3}reach the next stage.{2}
Here you must figure out{3}how the logs and stones{3}need to be moved.{2}
This is another{3}log-rolling area.{2}
The obstacle in this stage{3}is the water tank at{3}the exit.{2}
To get across the tank,{3}you'll need to roll{3}the logs.{2}
You can get through{3}quickly by moving the{3}logs and stones.{2}
This is the site of the{3}first finals battle.{2}
So this is where warriors{3}test their mettle{3}against each other.{2}
Well, no... It's actually{3}more than that.{2}
What else is involved?{2}
The warriors are racing{3}to get here first and{3}get the best equipment.{2}
So there's an advantage{3}to getting here first?{3}That's quite a test!{2}
That's too hard for{3}{17}{1}. We must support{3}him as well we can...{2}
Um, don't you want to{3}hear my explanation?{30}
All right. Then let{3}me explain in detail...{2}
Ask the attendants for{3}explanations of the{3}stages.{2}
Warriors enter the finals{3}without any of their{3}own equipment.{2}
Please look over there.{2}
That is the starting{3}point of the first{3}stage of the finals.{2}
You must get through{3}several stages before{3}you reach the arena.{2}
The chests along the way{3}contain items that may{3}be useful in battle.{2}
This is the battle arena.{3}After getting here,{3}the warriors do battle.{2}
You can get weapons in{3}the arena, too, but one is{3}weaker than the other.{2}
So you'll have the{3}advantage if you get{3}here first.{2}
Also, you can use the{3}equipment you get here{3}in your next match.{2}
What do you think, {17}{1}?{3}Do you understand the{3}rules for the finals?{30}
You'll notice that each{3}stage has its own{3}attendant.{2}
...Then I will explain it{3}to you once more.{2}
...{17}{1}, you're a{3}contestant in the finals.{3}Do not forget that.{1}I'll be right here, so{3}come see me when you're{3}done looking things over.{2}
Hey, where do we cheer{3}from?{2}
Would you like to visit{3}the stages and hear a{3}description for each one?{2}
Yes. We'll decide where{3}to cheer for {17}{1} after{3}hearing the descriptions.{2}
{17}{1}, did you get{3}a good look around?{30}
Let's head{3}back, then.{2}
Let me know when you're{3}done looking around.{2}
Wait, shouldn't you decide{3}where the best place to{3}cheer for {17}{1} is?{1}You can cheer from up{3}close at any stage, so{3}it's a tough call.{2}
This is the site of the{3}second finals match.{2}
As I explained earlier,{3}each stage has its own{3}attendant.{2}
Please ask the attendants{3}directly for descriptions{3}of each stage.{2}
...{17}{1}, that first{3}match was terrific.{1}I'll be right here,{3}so tell me when you're{3}done looking around.{2}
This is the site of the{3}third finals match.{2}
By now, you know that{3}each stage has its{3}own attendant.{2}
Ask the attendants{3}descriptions of{3}the stages.{2}
Honestly, {17}{1}, I{3}didn't think you'd{3}make it this far!{1}I'll be right here,{3}so tell me when you're{3}done looking around.{2}
{17}{1}!!!{2}
{17}{1}...{2}
{17}{1}...{2}
{17}{1}...{2}
{17}{1}...{2}
{17}{1}...{2}
{17}{1}...{2}
Huh?{5} {17}{1}'s the{3}only one entering{3}the finals?{2}
The warriors entered{3}in the finals must go{3}in alone.{2}
But why {17}{1}?{2}
That is what Babi{3}wanted...{2}
But I wanted to{3}enter, too!{2}
We aren't accepting{3}any more entries.{2}
Well, Master {17}{1},{3}please prepare yourself.{2}
I guess all you can do.{5}.{5}.{5}{3}is get it over with,{3}{17}{1}.{2}
I know you want to enter,{3}too, {17}{2}, but there's{3}nothing we can do.{2}
This is crazy! {17}{1}{3}won't survive against{3}those Colosso warriors!{2}
If {17}{1} wants to win,{3}he'll have to use{3}Psynergy.{2}
Well, Babi does seem very{3}interested in his{3}Psynergy...{2}
Even so, how's he{3}supposed to use{3}it here?{2}
What did Babi say we're{3}supposed to do while{3}{17}{1} is competing?{2}
We've made a slight{3}exception. You can cheer{3}him on from the stage.{2}
You'll be able to see{3}from right up close.{2}
This is the first time it{3}has ever been permitted!{3}You should thank Babi{1}for the chance to sit{3}in these special seats.{2}
If everything is settled,{3}I shall take you there.{2}
Umm{5}, can't {17}{1} go{3}to see the finals{3}stages, too?{2}
I bet you want to learn{3}as much as you can about{3}the finals, eh, {17}{1}?{30}
Of course, we won't{3}argue if you don't, but{3}if you can, you should.{2}
Come on, you can make{3}another exception,{3}can't you?{2}
...I don't see the{3}harm in it.{2}
I can't believe {17}{1}{3}is entering midway{3}through Colosso!{2}
This is a first!{3}Totally unheard of!{3}...Like I said earlier.{2}
Are we ready? I'll{3}give you a tour of{3}the arena. Let's go.{2}
Prepare yourselves,{3}contestants! The finals{3}will begin shortly.{2}
I am Morgan. I am the{3}highest-ranked warrior.{1}I am going to win{3}the finals! And don't{3}you forget it!{2}
I'm rated as the second-{3}best, but I'll prove them{3}wrong. The name's Azart.{1}Don't tell me YOU'RE the{3}one Babi handpicked to{3}be in the finals!?{2}
I'm not going to lose{3}to someone who didn't{3}even clear the trials.{2}
{9}{4}Waah!{7} Don't frighten me!{2}
I'm incredibly nervous.{3}Wha? Me? I... I'm Galahad,{3}the third-seeded fighter.{1}I can't wait any longer...{3}When do we start?{2}
...You who have come to{3}question me...{3}You are...{5}{17}{1}?{2}
I had closed my eyes...{3}to focus my mind{3}before battle.{2}
My name is Satrage.{3}I'm the fourth-ranked{3}warrior.{2}
Dekka must win the finals.{3}Dekka.{5} Dekka...{2}
He won't answer, no{3}matter how much you{3}speak to him.{2}
He's trying to get himself{3}psyched up for the battle.{2}
The finals can't be{3}won that easily!{2}
I am Navampa of{3}Gondowan, the sixth-{3}ranked warrior.{2}
You're the warrior Babi{3}selected? The one they're{3}all talking about?{2}
I heard rumors that you{3}were a huge, hulking man.{3}I guess they were wrong.{2}
I'm Buford, the seventh{3}seed.{2}
All who cleared the{3}trials are powerful{3}warriors...{2}
This is a balanced{3}match{24}anyone{3}could win today!{2}
Are you ready for the{3}finals? {30}
Then please wait in{3}the eighth circle.{2}
We'll be starting soon,{3}so you'd better get{3}ready fast!{2}
You cannot leave until{3}the finals are over.{2}
I feel we've been waiting{3}forever for the finals{3}to begin.{1}You know, I had this{3}same problem at my first{3}Colosso.{2}
When the gong sounds,{5}{3}the finals will begin.{2}
Hey, any day now! We're{3}tired of waiting! Let's{3}get this thing started!{2}
I agree... Let the{3}finals begin already.{2}
Um... Yeah. I'll show you...{3}We're here to win the{3}finals.{2}
Hey, what's the matter...{3}Hurry up and start!{2}
Line up starting with{3}the top-ranked warrior,{3}and await the signal!{2}
Now then, chosen warriors.{3}Let the finals begin!{2}
Curses!{3}Let's do it again!{2}
So, you're all set,{3}right?{2}
All right! Let the{3}games begin!{2}
I see you've made it{3}through your first{3}match.{2}
Winning your first match{3}after jumping right into{3}the finals is awesome!{2}
I should have expected{3}as much from a warrior{3}selected by Babi.{2}
Now, we can go have a{3}look at the next series{3}of stages...{2}
You've managed to win{3}both of your matches.{2}
You're incredible, {17}{1}!{3}If you win the next one,{3}you'll be the champion!{2}
A fantastic performance,{3}just as Babi expected...{1}I won't underestimate{3}you again!{2}
Let me take you to the{3}next group of stages.{2}
This year's finals are{3}incredible. This atmosphere{3}can't be beat!{2}
Moving such a huge rock{3}must be a real{3}workout.{2}
There's only one final, and{3}this is it. We're so{3}lucky to be here for it!{2}
Did you see his moves{3}out there on that{3}rickety bridge?{2}
How many warriors have{3}swallowed their pain to{3}get this chest?{2}
I can't believe{3}anybody ever gets{3}lost in that maze...{2}
How do they make that{3}floor move like that?{2}
I'm amazed people can{3}actually cross the logs{3}without falling in!{2}
Boy, that bit over there{3}must make their legs{3}feel like rubber.{2}
I heard Babi got the log-{3}rolling idea from his{3}trip to Kolima Forest.{2}
The street vendors' corn{3}on the cob looked sooo{3}good... Oh, I'm hungry!{2}
I can't see anything{3}when I'm facing{3}backward!{1}I only took this{3}job so I could see{3}the finals!{2}
It's not very exciting{3}work, but in my own{3}way, I do my best.{1}Isn't there anyone{3}to cheer for me?{2}
Standing for long periods{3}of time can really{3}wear you out...{2}
I was up all night trying{3}to memorize these stage{3}descriptions.{1}I've got 'em down pat!{2}
Some tourist told me I{3}look like the guy working{3}next door... The nerve!{2}
{17}{1} fell asleep...{2}
He must be exhausted.{2}
Let's leave him to{3}sleep for now.{2}
You...{5} You can {5}see me?{2}
Someone's there.{2}
Wrapped in Psynergetic{3}light... Who could it be?{2}
You know about Psynergy?{3}And you can see me?{2}
Come on, mister!{3}Don't hide{24}show{3}yourself!{2}
Even if I wanted to show{3}myself... As you can{3}see, I cannot move.{2}
What do you mean,{3}"as you can see"?{3}You're invisible!{2}
Oh... That's right.{2}
You say you can't{3}move... What happened?{2}
Hmmm, yes. I ran out of{3}my draught and collapsed{3}here.{2}
Draught?{2}
Exactly what kind of{3}draught is it?{2}
You couldn't even begin{3}to comprehend if I{3}tried to tell you. {9}{4}Cough.{7}{2}
You seem to be in a lot{3}of pain. Your life depends{3}on that draught, huh?{2}
It does. Could you do{3}me a favor?{2}
A favor? What is it?{2}
I'd like you to get{3}my draught for me.{2}
Get it? Where is it?{2}
Deep in this cave...{2}
What, is there a{3}pharmacy down there?{2}
Witty, aren't we? I'll{3}have to tell you how to{3}find it.{1}Can you do this for me?{30}
Are you kidding, {17}{1}?{3}We haven't even actually{3}seen this guy!{2}
He said he couldn't move{3}even if he wanted to,{3}right?{1}Someone is in trouble!{3}It's only natural to{3}want to help.{2}
I agree with {17}{3}{24}{3}whoever he is, he{3}needs our help.{2}
Fine! Okay! We should help{3}people in need.{3}Is that better!?{2}
I'm with you, {17}{1}. I{3}don't trust anyone who's{3}afraid to show himself.{2}
He said he couldn't{3}even move, didn't he?{1}Someone is in trouble!{3}It's only natural{3}to want to help.{2}
I agree with {17}{3}{27}{3}line of thinking.{2}
Fine! Whatever! We'll{3}help everybody who needs{3}help. Is that better?{2}
Will you get{3}it for me?!{2}
What do we have to do{3}to get your draught?{2}
First, you'll have to go{3}deep into the cave.{2}
You'll find five rocks{3}sticking up out of the{3}ground.{2}
Rotate the rocks on the{3}left and right sides.{2}
When you turn the rocks{3}in the right order, five{3}colored lights will appear.{2}
Colored lights!?{3}This sounds weird.{2}
That's right. Lights will{3}appear on the wall.{2}
There will be five colors:{3}blue, green, white,{3}yellow, and red.{2}
Turn the five rocks in{3}accordance with those{3}colors.{2}
Riiight... Spin the rocks{3}in accordance with{3}the color of the light...{2}
The blue light corresponds{3}to the rock farthest{3}to the left.{1}In order, the other{3}rocks are green, white,{3}yellow, and red.{1}When you see the light,{3}rotate the corresponding{3}rock.{2}
So, in order, left to{3}right, the colors are blue,{3}green, white, yellow, red?{2}
Correct. If you do this{3}correctly, a hidden{3}door will open.{2}
A door? Somewhere deep{3}in a cave? Who put it{3}there?{2}
An ancient civilization,{3}long since vanished.{3}{9}{4}Ohhh!{7} Please hurry!{2}
He seems to be in a lot{3}of pain. We'd better find{3}that cave, {17}{1}.{2}
Wait...{2}
The draught is...{3}on a table behind{3}the door.{2}
Did you forget the order{3}of rock colors?{30}
From the left, it's blue,{3}green, white, yellow,{3}and red.{1}Match the colors to{3}the rocks in order to{3}open the door.{2}
Deep in the cave are five{3}rocks. Turn the ones on{3}the ends first.{1}When the lights appear,{3}turn the rocks that{3}correspond to the colors.{2}
If they don't get{3}me that draught,{3}I{5}... I'll...{2}
You... You came back...{3}Please, the draught{24}{3}quickly.{2}
Oh, thank you!{3}You've saved my life.{1}{5}Squeak... {5}{9}{4}Glug glug glug...{7}{2}
Thank you for your{3}help. I'll be okay now.{2}
Look! It's a man!{2}
What are you talking{3}about? What did you{3}expect?{2}
Well, I mean, we couldn't{3}see who was talking...{2}
My sudden appearance{3}seems to have{3}startled you.{30}
I would have revealed{3}myself sooner, but I could{3}not even move...{2}
You must be well{3}traveled indeed if{3}that didn't shock you.{2}
How did you become{3}paralyzed while you{3}were invisible?{2}
And that ability to conceal{3}yourself... Are you{3}an Adept?{2}
An Adept? What are you{3}talking about?{2}
You used Psynergy to{3}conceal yourself,{3}didn't you?{1}Only an Adept could{3}do that.{2}
Oh, um... Yes, I{5} was{5} using{3}Psynergy to conceal{3}myself...{2}
Something in his{3}tale doesn't sound{3}right...{2}
I shall peer into{3}his heart.{2}
What's the matter, {17}{3}?{2}
This is Babi, the ruler{3}of Tolbi!{2}
And that {9}{2}wasn't{7} Psynergy{3}he was using to conceal{3}himself...{1}It was the power of an{3}ancient civilization!{2}
I said nothing of the{3}kind! How can you{3}know that?{2}
So, I guess that would{3}make you Adepts...{2}
Does that mean...{5}{3}Have I finally{3}found true Lemurians!?{2}
That's what I've been{3}saying! We're Adepts.{3}...But{5} what's Lemuria?{2}
Yes, what is{3}this "Lemuria"?{2}
What? You're Adepts...{3}but not Lemurians?{2}
So I was wrong...{2}
Are you searching for{3}these Lemurians, Babi?{2}
Babi, you're the ruler of{3}Tolbi... You can have{3}anything you want.{1}Why would you want{3}to find these{3}Lemurians?{2}
Even the ruler of Tolbi{3}has his limitations.{2}
Every year, I grow{3}older and more frail...{3}This body's had it.{2}
And you regret{3}growing older?{2}
I understand your{3}desire to remain young,{1}but there's nothing{3}anyone can do about it.{2}
Wait a sec, {17}{1}!{3}Do you remember when{3}we were in Sol Sanctum?{30}
That's right! Kraden said{3}Alchemy could thwart{3}death itself!{2}
You forgot? Kraden said{3}Alchemy could be used to{3}thwart death.{2}
What was that?{2}
Did you say you{3}know Kraden?{30}
Babi!{2}
We've been searching{3}everywhere for you,{3}Babi!{2}
Iodem said we would{3}find you in Altmiller{3}Cave!{2}
You're...not glad{3}we found you?{2}
No, it's not that.{2}
What are you doing in{3}a cave such as this,{3}my lord?{2}
I have my reasons...{2}
Everyone in Tolbi has{3}been in a panic over{3}your absence.{2}
I did not mean to{3}cause anyone any{3}undue concern.{2}
We're just happy we{3}found you before the{3}finals began.{2}
The trials have{3}already ended?{2}
Why have you been in{3}this cave for so long?{2}
I had{5}{5} an important{3}errand, but it has been{3}taken care of.{2}
Splendid! Then you can{3}attend the finals.{2}
I must speak more with{3}these people.{2}
Who are they?{2}
I{5}{5} owe my life{3}to them...{2}
Pardon our rudeness.{3}You have our gratitude{3}for saving Babi's life.{2}
We must have Iodem{3}grant them a reward.{2}
You can speak with them{3}again after the{3}finals are finished.{2}
Oh. I see...{3}If that's what we{3}have to do, then...{2}
I have not heard{3}your names yet.{2}
I'm {17}{2}.{2}
This is {17}{1}.{2}
I am {17}{3}.{2}
My name is {17}{4}.{2}
Come see me at my{3}palace once the finals{3}have ended.{2}
I would like to speak{3}with you further.{2}
Say, I have an idea...{3}Why don't you enter{3}the finals?{2}
You have some{3}interesting{3}powers.{2}
But, Lord Babi, they{3}have not cleared{3}the trials.{2}
Only warriors who clear{3}the trials can appear{3}in the finals.{2}
And you don't think that{3}saving my life qualifies{3}as a suitable trial?{2}
I look forward to{3}seeing you battle!{2}
He's asking us to{3}appear in Colosso,{3}isn't he?{2}
Is he serious?{2}
He wants to see us fight{3}using our Psynergy...{3}That's what it is.{2}
The finals...{3}Should we do it?{30}
So we'll do it?{2}
You don't want to{3}either, do you?{2}
Either way, we're stuck{3}here in Tolbi until{3}Colosso is over.{2}
Babi said that he wanted{3}to talk to us, didn't he?{2}
He seemed to{3}know Kraden.{2}
What could be the{3}connection between{3}Lemuria and Adepts?{2}
I suspect he knows{3}quite a bit about what's{3}going on with us.{2}
I guess all we can do is{3}wait around until Colosso{3}is over...{1}I hate just waiting{3}around...{2}
Come on, let's{3}enter Colosso!{3}Can we do it?{30}
Great! It's decided.{3}We'll just have to{3}do our best!{2}
If you want to do it,{3}{17}{1}, we'll go along{3}with you.{2}
What? Don't let me{3}down like this!{2}
I guess we'll just wait{3}until we reach Tolbi and{3}let {17}{1} decide there.{2}
{16} rotated{3}the rock.{2}
Colosso will reach its{3}apex any minute now.{1}Let's hurry to the{3}colosseum so we can see{3}the gladiators fighting!{2}
Are you planning to{3}watch the finals? They{3}may have already started!{2}
My family saved me a{3}seat at the colosseum,{3}so I'm set.{1}Still, we should{3}head to Colosso soon.{2}
I thought something{3}happened to Babi...{1}He made an appearance at{3}the finals, though, so I{3}guess it was nothing.{2}
The colosseum was so full{3}that I couldn't get in. I{3}only did the Lucky Guess.{2}
Nobody else has noticed,{3}but this year's festival{3}seems a little long.{2}
Hooray! It's the finals!{3}Seven warriors remain!{3}Only one final winner!{2}
Waah! My big brother{3}spent all our souvenir{3}money on Lucky Guess!{2}
How about some Colosso{3}souvenirs? This is your{3}last chance! 30% off!{2}
The finals are so long,{3}it's a good idea to buy{3}some food to take along!{2}
The trials were so{3}riveting!{1}The finals are even more{3}incredible.{3}I can't wait!{2}
I have seats to the finals.{3}They cost money. It is{3}too much.{2}
I overslept again, so I{3}can't get into the{3}colosseum!{1}Maybe I should buy{3}good seats from{3}a scalper...{2}
Oh, there are always{3}scalpers at the{3}Colosso finals!{1}I think scalpers only try{3}to cheat folks coming in{3}from the countryside.{2}
The finals are about to{3}start. It's kind{3}of sad.{2}
Just wait until Colosso{3}ends, like a good{3}kid.{2}
The prices drop once{3}Colosso ends, so buying{3}now would be foolish!{2}
They said they'd buy it{3}after Colosso ended, but{3}I wonder...{2}
The finals start today.{3}I wonder if my buddy{3}is doing all right.{1}If you need a seat,{3}buy a ticket from{3}my buddy.{2}
I've got to get to the{3}colosseum...{1}What'll I do if I miss{3}the height of the {3}battle!{2}
A battle to the death with{3}7 strapping warriors...{3}Oh, it's so exciting!{2}
The finals start on{3}Babi's signal.{3}I love that!{2}
So why were the soldiers{3}all distraught if nothing{3}was wrong with Babi?{2}
I could still buy seats{3}from a scalper, but I{3}hate doing that!{2}
No matter how I add it{3}up, this year's{3}festival is longer!{2}
We could win big if we{3}used our allowance to{3}enter the Lucky Guess.{2}
Mama, why did you{3}listen to my brother?{2}
We can't sell anything{3}once the finals end. We{3}have to sell it now!{2}
This is the final push!{3}Anything that isn't sold{3}will go to waste!{2}
Fighting in Colosso{3}requires a lot of power.{3}I couldn't do it.{2}
They're selling finals seats{3}right at the colosseum{3}entrance. It's too much!{2}
It's supposed to be free...{3}Having to buy seats from{3}scalpers is annoying.{2}
There's no way poor{3}soldiers like us can{3}afford scalped tickets!{2}
Once Colosso ends, our{3}lives can go back to{3}normal.{2}
Festivals are so{3}expensive.  My wallet's{3}empty!{2}
Mom, you said you were{3}all out of money, but{3}you're not!{2}
Today is a big day for{3}us scalpers. What do you{3}say, buddy?{2}
So, Colosso has already{3}reached the finals.{1}We have only a few{3}more days to make{3}some money.{2}
The festival schedule was{3}delayed for some{3}reason.{1}Thanks to that, we{3}made more money than{3}usual.{2}
That's strange... I wonder{3}what happened to all{3}my money.{2}
I just saw Babi, the{3}town's ruler!{1}He is very energetic{3}for someone his age,{3}isn't he?{2}
Are we making more{3}money now that the{3}festival is longer?{2}
So they did extend the{3}festival? I didn't hear{3}anything about it.{2}
I can't afford to stay{3}here.{1}I wonder when I should{3}tell the owner that I{3}don't have any money.{2}
The air in the{3}colosseum is so{3}tense when Babi's there.{2}
Here I am in Tolbi{3}for the finals, but{3}I'm stuck housesitting!{2}
If somebody else would{3}watch the house for me,{3}I could see the festival.{2}
I'm going to watch the{3}finals now... Please come{3}another time.{2}
Hooray! We're going{3}to Colosso now!{3}It's the finals!{2}
Colosso is already{3}at the finals!{1}Hurry! You gotta see{3}the fighting at the{3}colosseum.{2}
Since we didn't get to see{3}the trials, we're really{3}charged up for this!{2}
Babi showed himself at{3}the finals.{1}So was that whole thing{3}about him being missing{3}just a misunderstanding?{30}
Well, I guess so, since{3}he's in the colosseum{3}now.{2}
Huh? Then they found him{3}in time for the finals?{1}That sounds ludicrous!{2}
What's up? Babi decided{3}to show up for the{3}finals?{2}
So what were Babi's{3}soldiers doing searching{3}through town?{2}
Maybe watching the trials{3}is too much for Babi now{3}that he's older.{2}
Babi apparently has some{3}reason for building{3}the lighthouse.{1}But we have no way of{3}knowing what sort of{3}reason that might be.{2}
I heard Babi is searching{3}for something at sea!{2}
Before he started the{3}lighthouse, Babi sent many{3}soldiers to sea.{1}I wonder if his reason{3}for building the lighthouse{3}is related to the sea.{2}
Babi has been making{3}strange references to{3}his time approaching.{1}He sounds willing to{3}risk his life to find{3}what he's looking for.{2}
So, the Colosso finals{3}are finally here!{1}Once Colosso ends, it will{3}be our chance to{3}make some money!{2}
The tourists all buy{3}weapons and gear when{3}they leave. It's great!{2}
They require a lot of{3}healing herbs once the{3}finals begin.{1}It just goes to show{3}you how harsh the final{3}battles are.{2}
You could say the{3}warriors in the finals{3}are supermen.{1}They get their strength{3}back faster than{3}anyone I've seen.{2}
Hmm... Maybe I'll close{3}the shop so I can go{3}watch the finals.{2}
If Mom finds out I{3}went to watch the finals,{3}she's gonna ground me!{2}
Once the finals begin,{3}everyone tries to{3}ditch out on work.{2}
This year I'm not letting{3}anyone skip work for{3}Colosso!{1}No one's gotten{3}away so far...{2}
The wife has a close{3}eye on me, so I can't{3}go see Colosso.{1}But if I don't soon,{3}the finals will start{3}without me!{2}
Do you want to see{3}the finals so badly{3}you'd skip work to do it?{30}
Isn't it strange that{3}something so barbaric{3}is so much fun?{2}
Hmm, I thought all men{3}loved those battles.{1}To each their own,{3}I suppose.{2}
The moment I hear the{3}finals are starting, I{3}want to go watch. Weird.{2}
So, Colosso is ending{3}soon... It's kind of{3}sad.{2}
The Colosso finals are{3}starting soon. Shall we{3}go to the colosseum?{2}
Maybe I'll do some{3}research on the finals{3}for next year's Colosso.{2}
I'm the one who really{3}wants to skip work to{3}watch the finals!{2}
Once things settle down,{3}I'm sure these folks will{3}go to the colosseum, too.{2}
If the master slips out,{3}the lady will be upset.{3}That's our chance!{1}What's with the master?{3}He'd better go soon!{2}
We women are the only{3}ones who aren't hoping{3}to sneak out.{1}But this is no joke! We'll{3}have to do all the work{3}if they leave!{2}
Hasn't the master gone{3}to Colosso yet?{1}The lady must be keeping{3}tight watch this year. It's{3}hard to fool her.{2}
I don't have any{3}particular interest in the{3}fighting at Colosso.{1}But I am a little sad{3}the festival is going{3}to end...{2}
I want to see the finals,{3}but not all the praising{3}of the winner.{2}
The trial battles weren't{3}quite like I imagined...{1}It's probably a good{3}idea to watch the{3}finals too.{2}
If you miss the finals at{3}Tolbi's Festival,{3}you'll regret it.{1}Why don't you hurry on{3}to the colosseum for{3}the very moving finale.{2}
If you're not interested{3}in the final battles, can{3}we trade spots?{2}
You're {17}{1},{3}aren't you?{30}
Babi left word that{3}he would be waiting for{3}you at the colosseum.{1}Don't go to the palace.{3}Go directly to the{3}colosseum.{2}
Oh, I guess I was{3}mistaken...{2}
No, I'm certain it{3}was you.{2}
Babi left word that{3}he would be waiting for{3}you at the colosseum.{1}Don't go to the palace.{3}Go directly to the{3}colosseum.{2}
Babi wants you to go{3}straight to the{3}colosseum.{1}Don't even bother{3}going to the palace.{2}
{17}{1}, I'd really{3}like to thank you for{3}saving Babi.{1}He is waiting for you{3}now at the colosseum.{2}
Babi is waiting for you at{3}the colosseum. He wants{3}you to go straight there.{2}
Sure, they saved Babi, but{3}I'm still not convinced{3}they belong in the finals.{2}
Babi is a deliberate{3}man{24}he wouldn't play{3}favorites like that!{1}What could these{3}warriors possibly have{3}that Babi wants?{2}
Babi's soldiers have{3}gone to see the sights{3}at Colosso.{1}They're warriors, too, {3}so that ought to{3}get them pumped up!{2}
What are you doing?{3}Hurry over to{3}the colosseum!{2}
Those guys look really{3}confident about fighting!{1}I wonder what would{3}happen if they fought{3}at Colosso?{2}
The finals are all{3}that's left of this{3}year's Colosso...{1}I can't wait to see what{3}kind of battles there{3}will be!{2}
You all came to rest up{3}before the match,{3}didn't you?{1}Would you like to sleep{3}right now?{30}
Here you are.{3}Have a nice rest!{2}
If you're tired,{3}please feel free to{3}get some rest.{2}
Do you want to rest?{2}
Well, if you're tired,{3}please feel free to get{3}some rest.{2}
I hope you'll all do{3}well in the finals!{2}
Babi has returned and the{3}finals are set to begin!{2}
When Babi returned, he{3}headed off to the festival{3}without even resting.{1}The finals this year{3}must have some sort of{3}significance for him.{2}
What's going on? {17}{7}{3}is looking{3}much happier.{1}I wonder what happened{3}to make that girl smile.{2}
The soldiers came to see{3}{17}{7}. She's been in a{3}great mood ever since.{1}Those soldiers didn't{3}say anything that might{3}make me smile...{2}
Hmph! I wish Colosso{3}would hurry up and{3}end!{2}
A smile on a pretty girl{3}is much nicer than tears!{1}When I see {17}{7} in a{3}good mood, it makes me{3}feel happy too!{2}
{17}{7} is a good girl,{3}but she has a few quirks{3}that are all her own.{2}
I don't have the least{3}interest in Colosso.{1}But when it's over,{3}something really good{3}will happen.{2}
The finals are finally{3}here! I can't wait to see{3}how the battles turn out!{2}
I heard Babi has picked{3}some warriors for this{3}year's finals himself!{1}I'm anxious to see how{3}tough those warriors{3}are!{2}
The colosseum is already{3}full!{1}If you really want to{3}watch, buy a ticket{3}from those scalpers.{2}
A warrior named {17}{1}{3}was selected for the{3}finals by Babi.{1}Maybe I should put a{3}little money on Babi's{3}special warrior...{2}
Having a warrior who{3}wasn't in the trials{3}appear in the finals{1}is really going to{3}mess things up.{2}
I want to watch the finals{3}from a good spot{5},{3}but it costs too much!{2}
It was hard for me to{3}get seats too... Come on{3}make up your mind!{2}
Hey, hold on a second!{2}
You want seats?{30}
I've got a customer I'm{3}talking to here!{1}Catch me later.{2}
Then, what? You got a{3}problem? I'm busy. I don't{3}need any distractions!{2}
Want to try out the{3}Lucky Guess?{30}
Let me know if you want{3}to play, okay?{2}
Aren't you {17}{1}? The{3}one handpicked by{3}Babi?{30}
You can't fool me...{3}You fit the features{3}I've heard about exactly!{1}Sorry, but warriors who{3}are actually fighting{3}can't play.{2}
Look, I'm sorry, but we{3}have some rules to help{3}keep things legit.{1}Warriors who made the{3}finals, and their team{3}members, can't play.{2}
The real battles are about{3}to begin at the colosseum!{1}The strongest warrior{3}will be determined by{3}these battles.{2}
The warrior named{3}{17}{1} is sure to{3}be an incredible fighter.{1}I picked {17}{1} in the{3}Lucky Guess.{2}
Of course it's the{3}rich who have the money{3}to buy seats at the finals.{1}They always get to have{3}all the fun without{3}having to work hard!{2}
There can be upsets{3}in the Colosso finals,{3}you know.{1}There's no guarantee{3}the warrior chosen{3}by Babi will win.{2}
What kind of warrior{3}is that {17}{1} guy{3}who Babi chose?{2}
Maybe I will buy a{3}seat... I don't know{3}what to do!{2}
I'm going to be in trouble{3}if I get stuck with any{3}unsold seats...{2}
All of the profits from{3}the Lucky Guess go to{3}Babi.{1}If it weren't for that,{3}we'd make a killing!{2}
Hey, you're {17}{1}!{2}
You're kidding... That's{3}{17}{1}? The one Babi{3}picked?{2}
Yeah{5}, there's no{3}mistaking it...{3}He's {17}{1}, for sure.{2}
He's just a kid!{3}What does Babi think{3}Colosso is? A playground?{2}
Putting him in the finals{3}is an insult to everyone{3}who cleared the trials!{2}
Don't you people{3}have faith in Babi?{2}
Babi wouldn't let him into{3}the finals just to repay{3}a favor!{2}
I guess Babi wouldn't{3}let {17}{1} in if he{3}weren't a good match.{2}
We've been waiting for{3}you and your friends,{3}{17}{1}.{2}
All of the Colosso{3}participants go to the{3}waiting room, OK?{30}
All right, this way{3}please.{2}
{17}{1}! You can't just{3}{9}{2}watch{7} the finals!{3}You're fighting in them!{2}
Babi is looking forward{3}to seeing your battles.{2}
He'll be angry if you just{3}watch from the sidelines.{3}Trust me on that.{2}
We were told to make{3}sure you appear in the{3}finals, no matter what.{2}
Really, you might as well{3}get used to the idea.{1}You're competing{3}in the finals.{2}
Well, it seems we have no{3}choice{24}we have to{3}fight in the finals!{2}
Would it cause problems{3}for everyone if we{3}didn't do this?{2}
I don't want to be the{3}source of any trouble.{3}Let's fight.{2}
We're in a fix, {17}{1}.{3}We have to do it,{3}don't you think?{30}
We appreciate this,{3}{17}{1}. Well, come this{3}way, please.{2}
Why do you have to be so{3}stubborn at a time like{3}this?{2}
{17}{2}, why don't you{3}pretend to be{3}our leader...{1}just until we're in the{3}participants' room?{2}
Yes. Maybe once we get{3}that far, {17}{1} will{3}have a better mindset.{2}
All right, guys!{3}Lead on!{2}
{17}{1}!{1}Get up, {17}{1}!{2}
Are you okay? You were{3}having nightmares for{3}quite a while...{2}
What's the matter,{3}{17}{1}?{2}
What? You entered{3}and fought in the finals?{2}
How could you? You{3}haven't even been to the{3}colosseum yet, {17}{1}!{1}You came here to get a{3}little rest before{3}the finals.{2}
Sounds like you've been{3}dreaming, {17}{1}.{2}
You're so exhausted, it's{3}giving you nightmares. Are{3}you okay now, {17}{1}?{30}
You think you can manage?{1}I understand, but don't{3}overdo it, OK, {17}{1}!{2}
{17}{1}'s awake now,{3}so let's head over to{3}the colosseum.{2}
Okay! We're off to{3}the colosseum!{2}
If you're tired,{3}please feel free{3}to rest.{2}
I hope you all perform{3}well in the finals.{2}
{17}{1}...{2}
Huh?{2}
You've awakened.{2}
Colosso? Duh! That ended{3}long ago!{2}
You fell into a{3}deep sleep...{3}Don't you remember?{30}
Oh, gimme a break.{3}You were out cold! You{3}don't remember a thing!{2}
Of course he doesn't!{3}He was out cold!{3}...You had us worried!{2}
I'm sorry for shouting{3}at you.{2}
You fought brilliantly{3}to the end, {17}{1}.{1}Babi was singing{3}your praises.{2}
Are you okay now?{3}In body and mind?{30}
He'd better be all right,{3}after sleeping this{3}long. Sheesh!{2}
If you feel out of sorts,{1}it's probably because{3}you slept too long!{3}Sheesh!{2}
I'm sorry for shouting{3}again.{2}
Babi said he wanted to{3}see you when you came{3}to, {17}{1}.{2}
If you're okay,{3}shall we go see Babi?{2}
You're fine!{3}Aren't you, {17}{1}?{2}
I'm not sure {17}{1}'s{3}up to it just yet.{2}
What is it? Feeling weak?{3}Fresh air and a walk{3}will fix that, right?{2}
I'm more worried{3}about what Babi wants.{3}Let's get going!{2}
Are you sure you should{3}be getting up so{3}suddenly like that?{2}
He's fine.{3}He doesn't want to{3}lounge around all day!{2}
I see. Let's go see{3}Babi then.{2}
I've lost all my enthusiasm{3}since Colosso ended.{1}I can't wait until{3}next year's festival!{2}
All the warriors who{3}stayed in the palace left{3}when Colosso ended.{1}Are you folks leaving{3}too?{30}
Oh, that's too bad. I bet{3}we could have had a{3}good time together.{2}
Huh? I thought for sure{3}you'd be going, too.{3}I guess not...{2}
The end of a festival{3}is always the loneliest{3}time of year.{2}
All the heroic warriors{3}who took part in Colosso{3}should remain in Tolbi.{1}Finding warriors like{3}that is why Babi holds{3}Colosso in the first place!{2}
Did you meet with Babi?{30}
Please lend Babi your{3}assistance.{1}Babi is counting on{3}your help.{2}
Why aren't you going to{3}meet with Babi to{3}discuss things?{1}He wants to talk to{3}you before you leave.{2}
So, you're all from the{3}eastern shores of the{3}Karagol Sea, huh?{1}Do you want to go{3}back already?{30}
Oh, that's too bad.{5}..that{3}no one will set sail on{3}the Karagol Sea, I mean.{1}Why don't you let Babi{3}take care of you until{3}your ship sails?{2}
You don't? That's great!{3}Babi will be very happy{3}to hear it.{2}
I haven't seen much of{3}Babi lately. It's as if he's{3}afraid of something.{1}What in the world{3}could frighten him?{2}
It would be a waste to{3}let you leave, {17}{1}.{1}I certainly will not{3}tell you how to return{3}to the east.{2}
No one's going to sleep{3}in this big bedroom{3}until the next Colosso!{1}Even so, we still have to{3}keep it cleaned up.{3}I hate that!{2}
Would this room get very{3}dusty if I didn't clean{3}it all year?{1}Yeah, that won't do.{3}I guess I'll just have{3}to tidy up.{2}
Babi was found safe and{3}sound, and Colosso ended{3}without incident.{1}We're relieved{3}everything went so well.{2}
Now that Colosso is over,{3}I'm going to Gondowan to{3}build Babi Lighthouse!{2}
The southern continent{3}is a dangerous place.{3}If you ever go there,{1}you'll know why I prefer{3}Angara. There truly is{3}no more peaceful land.{2}
I was hoping I'd be the{3}one to find Babi! Oh well,{3}it's too late now.{2}
Colosso has ended, so we{3}have to go back to{3}building the lighthouse.{1}{5}I still don't get{3}why Babi wants it{3}finished so soon.{2}
I want that lighthouse{3}finished quickly, so I can{3}say good-bye to Gondowan.{2}
Once Babi Lighthouse is{3}complete, I'd like to{3}move there!{1}I'll spend my time{3}poring over the{3}Venus Ruins.{2}
You folks seem to know{3}quite a bit about Kraden,{3}don't you?{30}
We haven't heard from{3}him in years... To think{3}he was in your village!{1}I wonder if he ever{3}found the legendary{3}Elemental Stars?{2}
I'm shocked to hear no{3}one knew he was from{3}here.{1}I wonder why Kraden{3}never told anyone in Vale{3}about Tolbi.{2}
Alchemy teaches that the{3}four elements, earth,{3}water, fire, and wind...{1}form the basis for{3}everything.{1}You can create{3}anything by combining{3}those elements...{2}
If the riddle of the{3}Venus Ruins were solved,{3}we wouldn't have to{1}build Babi Lighthouse.{3}We continue to study, but{3}we make little progress.{2}
I'm sure Kraden would{3}stop by if he ever came{3}through here again.{1}Babi took very good{3}care of Kraden...{2}
The relationship between{3}Alchemy and the Venus{3}Ruins seems strong.{1}I'll solve the riddle{3}of the lighthouse and{3}show them all!{2}
I want to see Kraden{3}and reveal something{3}about Alchemy to him.{2}
There's got to be a{3}good reason for calling{3}the four Elementals...{1}the Four Great Bases. If{3}we can find out why, we{3}might turn lead into gold!{2}
What sort of unfathomable{3}riddles are hiding in{3}the Venus Ruins?{2}
There must be a reason{3}why Kraden has not{3}returned to Tolbi.{2}
I've been waiting for{3}you and your companions,{3}{17}{1}!{2}
I've been waiting here{3}because I wanted to{3}speak with you.{2}
It's hard to talk when {3}you're so far away...{3}Come over here.{2}
The battles at Colosso{3}were spectacular!{2}
It was most rewarding{3}to see Babi's favored{3}warrior steal the day.{2}
Iodem, bring him the{3}victor's prize.{2}
Yes, sir, right away.{2}
{17}{1} received{3}{20}{2}.{2}
Incidentally, {17}{1},{3}are you feeling better{3}now?{30}
It was wonderful to see{3}Babi's handpicked{3}warrior make it so far!{2}
Incidentally, {17}{1},{3}are you feeling better{3}now?{30}
Ah, the recuperative{3}powers of youth...and{3}after such fierce battles!{2}
You must be exhausted.{3}I'm amazed to see you on{3}your feet after Colosso.{2}
Who could expect less{3}from the warriors who{3}rescued me?{2}
Enough with the flattery.{3}Let's get to the point:{3}why were we summoned?{2}
Such insolence! Who{3}do you think you are,{3}to speak to Babi so?{2}
Let it be, Iodem. There{3}are other ways to{3}judge a man.{2}
What is it you said you{3}were called?{2}
He's talking to{3}you, {17}{2}.{2}
That's right, {17}{2}.{3}We shall explain all.{2}
We intended to thank you{3}and your companions for{3}saving Babi, {17}{1}.{2}
But it would seem that{3}gratitude is not enough...{2}
I have disclosed{3}everything to Iodem.{2}
What do you mean{3}by everything?{2}
You do wish to know{3}more about Lemuria,{3}correct?{30}
Yes, indeed... Your desire{3}is as plain as day.{2}
You can't hide your{3}interest from me. It is{3}written on your faces.{2}
I have just seen Psynergy{3}for the first time...{3}It is an awesome power...{2}
I used my Cloak Ball{3}to show him Psynergy.{2}
No one else could see{3}it, but I knew {17}{1}'s{3}tournament was strange.{2}
I thought it unlikely{3}that you would fight{3}using such power...{2}
No need to be ashamed,{3}{17}{1}. Psynergy{3}is also a warrior's power.{2}
When I first learned{3}of your power, I was{3}shocked.{1}I thought you might{3}be Lemurians.{2}
You have mentioned{3}Lemuria many times,{3}Babi. What is it?{2}
It is the city of an{3}ancient people, lying far{3}out at sea.{2}
Many years ago, about the{3}time of the great flood,{3}Babi went to Lemuria.{2}
I see...{2}
The great flood struck{3}while I was traveling{3}with Lunpa.{2}
Lunpa... You mean{3}Lunpa the thief?{2}
I know it is hard to{3}believe... It happened a{3}hundred years ago.{2}
You mean...those rumors{3}about you are...true?{2}
Kraden once mentioned the{3}Stone of Sages. Do you{3}think that's what did it?{30}
So the stone that grants{3}immortality came from{3}Lemuria?{2}
Huh? Don't tell me{3}you forgot about{3}the Stone of Sages...{30}
It rules all, can change{3}anything into gold, grants{3}immortality.{5} Ring a bell?{2}
I can't think of anything{3}else that would let him{3}live for so long.{2}
So you've even heard of{3}the Stone of Sages... I'm{3}afraid I don't have it.{2}
It is the draught of{3}Lemuria that has allowed{3}me to live for so long.{2}
The draught of{3}Lemuria?{2}
It is a magical draught{3}once taken by those{3}who lived in Lemuria.{2}
And just drinking stops{3}you from aging?{2}
Is that what it does?{2}
Hmmm...{5} It would be{3}more accurate to say it{3}slows the aging process.{2}
There is death in{3}Lemuria...{2}
But it only comes to those{3}whose senses have failed{3}from centuries of use.{2}
Do the people of Lemuria{3}use Psynergy, like we do?{2}
You have that draught,{3}Babi... That's why you've{3}lived so long.{2}
And become wealthy{3}enough to rule Tolbi.{2}
What are you{3}getting at?{2}
What is your purpose{3}in making everyone{3}study Alchemy?{2}
I'm starting to wonder{3}myself. What do you hope{3}to gain, Babi?{2}
Ah. If I had attained{3}true immortality...{1}There would be{3}no need for all{3}this research.{2}
I'm not sure I understand.{2}
I had precious little{3}draught, and now I{3}am running out.{2}
You all saw it. There{3}was but little left in{3}the cave...{2}
How long will it last?{3}And what will happen{3}when it runs out?{2}
It will run out any day{3}now. And when it does,{3}my life is at its end...{2}
Why didn't you tell us{3}sooner? We must hurry{3}to Lemuria!{2}
It is pointless...{2}
What on earth do you{3}mean, pointless?{2}
We cannot find{3}Lemuria.{2}
But you just said that{3}it lies far out at{3}sea...{2}
If we search the seas,{3}we're sure to find it!{2}
I've sent so many ships{3}in the past in{3}search of Lemuria.{2}
This must have been long{3}before I joined you... But{3}still you failed?{2}
I needed more Lemurian{3}draught, but I couldn't{3}find Lemuria.{2}
Why did you collapse{3}in the cave if you{3}still had more draught?{2}
I have been rationing it,{3}but this time, I waited{3}too long between drinks.{2}
You were trying to make{3}it last longer...{2}
I overexerted myself{3}trying to find Lemuria{3}before it ran out.{2}
And your reason for{3}calling us here has{3}to do with Lemuria?{2}
Exactly. I want you{3}to find Lemuria.{2}
I have not been able{3}to locate Lemuria by{3}sea, but perhaps by air...{2}
I can hide it no longer...{1}I have built Babi{3}Lighthouse to see if I can{3}find Lemuria at sea.{2}
What? That's why you're{3}building the lighthouse?{2}
No, there's more to{3}it than that.{2}
We've  spotted something{3}in the ocean southeast{3}of the lighthouse.{5}.{5}.{1}where Lemuria{3}should be.{2}
Something dangerous, no{3}doubt. What, monsters?{3}We can handle 'em...{2}
That may be...{3}However, something else{3}troubles me more.{2}
What is it, my lord?{2}
No sailor has been able{3}to keep his bearings{3}at sea.{2}
You're kidding! You mean{3}they can't even keep a{3}straight course?{2}
Is there something that{3}distorts distance or{3}direction or something?{2}
The currents shift there,{3}subtly changing a ship's{3}direction.{2}
So the lighthouse will{3}help the ships keep{3}their bearings...{2}
So, how exactly did you{3}get away from Lemuria{3}after the flood, Babi?{2}
That is the thing,{3}{17}{2}!{2}
I crossed the sea in a{3}Lemurian ship. I am hoping{3}you can sail it...{2}
But why us, when you{3}have so many powerful{3}soldiers at your disposal?{2}
None of them have the{3}ability to use Psynergy.{2}
One must have Psynergy{3}to sail this ship!{2}
Then that would mean{3}that Babi is an Adept,{3}wouldn't it?{30}
That must be it. No{3}normal person could use{3}that Cloak Ball.{2}
But, {17}{1}, no normal{3}person could master{3}the Cloak Ball!{2}
I learned to use a little{3}Psynergy during my stay{3}in Lemuria.{2}
With what little I'd{3}learned, I was able{3}to guide the ship.{2}
In that case, perhaps...{3}I could sail the ship.{2}
No. It must be an Adept.{2}
What should we do,{3}{17}{1}? Will you do{3}what he wants?{2}
If you do, I will{3}grant you whatever{3}you wish.{2}
You shouldn't make vows{3}you will later find{3}you cannot keep...{2}
I haven't even{3}considered my own{3}wishes lately.{2}
In that case, I could{3}provide you with a wealth{3}of items you might like.{2}
Babi's offer is very{3}generous... You will{3}consider going, won't you?{30}
{17}{1}, we have to{3}beat {17}{5} and the{3}others to the lighthouse.{2}
Not this time. We have to{3}beat {17}{5} and the{3}others to the lighthouse.{2}
The lighthouse!?{2}
Do you mean Venus{3}Lighthouse?{2}
Well then, our paths are{3}intertwined. I, too, must{3}go to Venus Lighthouse.{2}
But we cannot get to{3}the top of Venus{3}Lighthouse, can we?{2}
These Adepts may be able{3}to solve the riddle{3}that blocks us.{2}
Ah, I see... The thought{3}hadn't occurred to me.{2}
{17}{1}! You shall go{3}to Venus Lighthouse{3}with Iodem.{2}
Do not worry...{1}You can take care of{3}your own business{3}first.{2}
I see... If they can solve{3}the riddle of the{3}lighthouse...{1}then our own wishes{3}will have been fulfilled.{2}
So, we can search for{3}Lemuria after they{3}complete their own quest...{2}
Is that acceptable?{30}
Ah, you will undertake{3}this quest! I am most{3}grateful!{2}
If you need time to make{3}up your mind, then{3}please do so.{2}
In any case, you will{3}need my assistance to{3}reach the lighthouse.{2}
I'll make preparations{3}so that I am ready to{3}leave at any time.{2}
I take my leave now{3}to make preparations.{2}
Then you can all meet{3}at Gondowan Passage...{2}
That's a brilliant idea!{2}
One more thing. I'd like{3}you to think about a{3}suitable reward.{2}
Yes. I will take care{3}of that immediately,{3}as well.{2}
I shall be waiting for{3}you at the passage.{2}
Your first task shall be{3}the riddles of Venus{3}Lighthouse.{1}I am counting on{3}you, {17}{1}!{2}
Sleeping a lot helps{3}to delay the need to{3}drink more draught.{1}If you find Lemuria and{3}return with more draught,{3}I won't have to do this.{2}
Babi's face is very{3}pale, like that of{3}a dead man.{1}It's no use worrying,{3}though. There's nothing{3}we can do about it.{2}
I wish I had met you and{3}your companions sooner,{3}{17}{1}.{1}But I suppose it was{3}not fated to be...{2}
If something happens to{3}Babi, what will become of{3}Tolbi?{1}Just thinking about{3}it frightens me.{2}
You found the{3}Cloak Ball.{2}
{17}{1}! Is that Cloak{3}Ball what you desire?{30}
Then please leave the{3}Cloak Ball alone.{1}Do not worry about{3}your reward. Iodem has{3}prepared it for you.{2}
That Cloak Ball is very{3}precious to me.{3}I can't just give it away.{1}But perhaps you could{3}borrow it. Take it with{3}you on your quest.{2}
You got the Cloak Ball.{2}
If you use the Cloak Ball{3}in the shadows, monsters{3}won't be able to see you.{1}That's how I was able{3}to get through{3}Altmiller Cave.{2}
Why would an Adept like{3}you need the Cloak Ball,{3}{17}{1}?{2}
The girl from Lalivero{3}is no longer here.{1}She has left for Lalivero{3}with the soldiers going{3}to Babi Lighthouse.{2}
I am surprised {17}{7} was{3}allowed to return to{3}Lalivero like that.{1}At least she won't be{3}homesick any longer.{2}
It seemed only natural{3}that {17}{7} should{3}return to Lalivero...{1}But who ordered it?{2}
I am so relieved {17}{7}{3}has returned to her{3}hometown.{1}But now that she's{3}gone, I find I miss{3}her a little.{2}
Well, this year's Colosso{3}has ended.{1}Be sure to come to Tolbi{3}again for next year's{3}festival, okay?{2}
It's back to our normal{3}quiet lives, now that{3}Colosso is over?{1}Oh, man! I'm bored!{2}
You were in the finals,{3}weren't you?{30}
I was moved by how you{3}were so determined,{3}despite your size.{2}
What? You weren't?{3}You know, you look just{3}like that warrior.{2}
With all those revelers{3}gone, the town sure feels{3}empty...{1}The period right after{3}the festival is unbearably{3}lonesome, huh?{2}
I had no luck in{3}the Lucky Guess. Maybe{3}next year will go better.{2}
It's so quiet! The hustle{3}and bustle of Colosso{3}seems like a dream!{2}
Yay! It's really easy{3}to run with no one{3}around.{2}
Ha ha ha ha. This is{3}fun! My big brother is{3}being nice to me again!{2}
I'll be back to do{3}business in Tolbi{3}again next year.{2}
Hey there, these are{3}leftovers, but have some!{2}
You got some corn.{2}
The festival was longer{3}than usual this year,{3}so I made more money.{1}I hope it's long again{3}next year.{2}
The spectators have all{3}left, so we have to clean.{3}What a pain!{2}
Think how fun it would{3}be to have Colosso all{3}year long!{1}Whew! That would be{3}a lot of work for us!{2}
All the warriors who{3}gain fame in the finals{3}become Babi's soldiers.{1}That's why Babi's{3}soldiers are so{3}powerful.{2}
Come to think of it,{3}no ships are sailing{3}in the Karagol, are they?{1}How are all the tourists{3}going to get home?{2}
Hmm... Since Colosso{3}ended so dramatically, the{3}Lucky Guess goes to...{1}Dang. Just a bit more{3}luck, and I could've been{3}a very wealthy man...{2}
The calm after the storm{3}is pretty nice too,{3}don't you think?{2}
The main street in Tolbi{3}is so wide open!{2}
My brother was mean to{3}me during the festival.{3}He changed completely!{2}
Every year I try to sell{3}everything, but I always{3}have stuff left over.{1}How am I supposed to{3}carry all this stuff{3}home?{2}
How can we get home if{3}sea monsters are{3}blocking the crossing?{2}
Now that Colosso is over,{3}we've closed our{3}makeshift inn.{2}
We had a lot of guests{3}again this year.{1}Maybe we'll take a{3}trip with all the{3}money we made.{2}
Sigh... Making the beds{3}has worn me out!{1}I'm going to enjoy myself{3}for a while with{3}the money I made.{2}
I'd love a vacation,{3}but where should{3}we go?{1}We can't get to Kalay,{3}and there's nothing{3}to see in Gondowan!{2}
I rented my house to a{3}rich family and tried{3}to head east...{1}but Silk Road is blocked,{3}and nobody's taking people{3}across the Karagol!{2}
The tourists are all in{3}a fix, because the ships{3}aren't sailing.{1}If we just had a few{3}Colosso warriors, we{3}could make it.{2}
Once the ships start{3}sailing again, I think{3}we'll go to Kalay.{2}
I heard of a cave that{3}leads to the Karagol's{3}far shore somewhere.{2}
I was so moved by{3}this year's Colosso!{1}I already can't wait for{3}next year's Colosso!{2}
That little guy jumped{3}straight into battle with{3}those huge gladiators!{1}It was amazing!{3}This was the best{3}Colosso ever!{2}
The warriors who fought{3}in the finals were{3}incredible!{2}
Daring and bravery are{3}nice and all{5}, but I'll{3}leave it to the warriors.{2}
Did you know Mt. Aleph{3}erupted? It wreaked{3}havoc across the land.{1}Maybe that's why Colosso{3}had so few spectators{3}this year.{2}
Maybe Aleph's eruption{3}caused those sea monsters{3}to appear in the Karagol.{2}
The sparkling stones that{3}rained from the sky...{1}They couldn't have{3}been volcanic rock,{3}could they?{2}
I'll bet the monsters were{3}frightened by the eruption{3}and went wild.{2}
The warriors said they{3}would rush to finish the{3}lighthouse after Colosso.{1}I'd love to see it{3}once it's finished.{2}
There won't be many{3}customers until next{3}year's festival,{1}so I'll be traveling{3}around selling my wares{3}until then.{2}
It bothers me a bit{3}that they're building the{3}lighthouse in Gondowan.{2}
There aren't many{3}merchants at the{3}lighthouse yet.{1}I'm sure I can make a{3}tidy sum there.{2}
Did you come all the{3}way from Kalay?{30}
It's too bad you can't{3}go back...{1}Looks like you're stuck{3}until the road is{3}repaired.{2}
The people visiting from{3}the east are all stuck at{3}Karagol Sea Port.{2}
Even without the ships,{3}I could still break even{3}if they just fix the road.{1}I would give just{3}about anything for{3}that to happen!{2}
You're {17}{1}, right?{3}The one that did so well{3}in the finals!{1}I'm amazed someone as{3}skinny as you could{3}do that well!{2}
Did all the warriors who{3}fought in the finals{3}become Babi's soldiers?{2}
I wasn't able to watch{3}the finals this year!{1}My mother says that{3}a new warrior named{3}{17}{1} did really well.{2}
I'm gonna watch the{3}finals next year{3}for sure!{2}
I thought we'd have some{3}free time once Colosso{3}ended, but no!{1}The spectators from Kalay{3}are back because they{3}can't get back home.{2}
The spectators from the{3}east can't go back home...{3}It's just awful.{2}
It's busy all day,{3}every day! I'm so busy{3}my head is spinning!{1}Sheesh! I thought{3}we'd get to take it{3}easy after Colosso!{2}
Hey, what's this?{2}
Uh-oh.{2}
I didn't find anything!{2}
I was just doing some{3}work I...had to do.{2}
It's rude to startle{3}people!{2}
Hee hee! Do I look like{3}I'm that excited?{30}
I see. That must be{3}because the weather{3}is nice.{2}
Yeah! I'm the same{3}as always.{2}
Oh... Hello!{2}
Ho hum. I'm fine.{3}It's nothing.{2}
You look like a warrior,{3}but you were watching{3}Colosso, right?{30}
Tsk! Just watching{3}doesn't make you any{3}better than the next guy!{1}If you're a warrior,{3}you ought to fight{3}next time.{2}
Oh? Didn't even watch?{1}What are you, crazy?{3}Colosso is the best{3}thing ever!{2}
Grrr! The chef is in a{3}bad mood because he{3}didn't get to see Colosso!{1}Taking that out on{3}us isn't very mature!{2}
I went to the port, but{3}they said the ships aren't{3}sailing, so I came back.{1}We made it to Tolbi{3}with your help. Maybe{3}we could make it back...{2}
Colosso has ended, but{3}we still can't get{3}across the Karagol.{1}Maybe they'll row us{3}home if we agree{3}to help out again...{2}
He won't sail the ship,{3}even though we agreed{3}to do whatever it takes?{2}
Co{5}-Correct. The ships{3}cannot go out for{3}any reason.{2}
What kind of person{3}would refuse such an{3}offer?{2}
You tell the captain{3}again that he needs to{3}set sail tomorrow.{2}
Grrr! What a scam! Why{3}won't they let the ships{3}sail out after Colosso!?{2}
Once this guy gets{3}mad, there's no{3}controlling him.{2}
I wonder if this{3}really is the best{3}room in the place.{2}
Tolbi gets so boring{3}once the festival ends!{3}I wanna go home!{2}
Hey! You're the would-be{3}warrior! Do you{3}remember me?{30}
You do? Wow! That's{3}great!{1}Neither of us can get{3}back to Kalay... We're{3}stuck, aren't we!{2}
It's me! We rode the{3}same ship from Kalay!{3}I guess you forgot.{2}
I got to see Colosso, so{3}I don't care if I can't{3}get across the Karagol.{1}Those warriors who{3}fought in Colosso were{3}incredibly built.{2}
Since the ships aren't{3}sailing, the port is{3}full of stranded tourists.{2}
Hee hee. It's great! The{3}inns are still full{3}even after Colosso.{2}
Everyone is working on{3}Babi Lighthouse, so{3}there's no one to rebuild{1}the road! Looks like the{3}inns will be full for{3}quite a while!{2}
Heh heh! She just hid{3}that thing she found{3}behind that trash pile.{1}Nobody will ever know{3}it's there...{2}
That thing I found is{3}definitely the same as the{3}one that man showed me.{1}But he wouldn't{5} ask me{3}to return it, would he?{2}
Grrr! I didn't get to{3}see any of Colosso!{1}Sigh. I'm trying not to{3}think about it, but...I get{3}so mad, it makes me sick.{2}
Hey, Chef! So what if{3}you missed it again?{3}Grow up, you big baby!{2}
I tried going to the{3}eastern cave, but it's{3}impossible to get through.{1}It was just like the{3}guards at the gate{3}told us.{2}
You'd think you could{3}get through the cave east{3}of Gondowan Passage...{1}but you can't. Not unless{3}you can lift boulders,{3}at any rate.{2}
You're saying if we row,{3}we can set sail? If that's{3}a joke, it's not funny.{1}Making passengers row{3}their own cruise ship is{3}unprecedented!{2}
The crew is saying that{3}if we all row, the ship{3}can depart.{1}My husband's pretty{3}mad about it!{2}
I'm sick of staying at{3}this miserable inn!{1}I'm willing to pay{3}extra if I can stay{3}at Babi Palace!{2}
If Mom had just bought{3}me some souvenirs, this{3}would be more fun.{2}
That voyage across the{3}sea was frightful!{3}I've learned my lesson.{2}
No matter what happens,{3}I'm coming to see Colosso{3}next year for sure!{2}
If the ships aren't going,{3}why not forget heading{3}east and enjoy Tolbi?{2}
You all got to see{3}Colosso, so quit griping!{1}I wanted to go, too,{3}but I missed the{3}whole blasted thing!{2}
Colosso is over and the{3}colosseum will be{3}closed until next year.{1}Since you've come all{3}this way, take a long look{3}at the beautiful gates!{2}
Did you come to get{3}your Lucky Guess prize{3}money?{30}
I'm pretty sure that{3}{18}{1}, the guy{3}you bet on, won!{1}Here are your winnings.{3}Please take them.{2}
It takes a great deal of{3}luck to win at{3}Lucky Guess!{2}
Really? But we already{3}paid out all the prize{3}money to the winners.{2}
You got {22} coin{25}.{2}
You didn't? Well, the{3}colosseum is closed{3}until next year.{1}If you want to look{3}inside, you'll have{3}to wait until then.{2}
The colosseum is closed{3}until next year.{1}If you want to look{3}inside, you'll have to{3}come back then.{2}
When the colosseum gates{3}finally shut, that truly{3}marks the end of Colosso.{2}
I'm waiting here 'cause{3}he told me to give him{3}his Lucky Guess winnings,{1}but that warrior still{3}hasn't shown up.{2}
The fighting at this{3}year's Colosso was{3}incredible!{1}Standing in front of{3}this lonely gate makes{3}me kind of sad.{2}
Do you wish to cross{3}into Gondowan?{30}
I won't stop you, but{3}I wouldn't go unless{3}I had business there.{1}I'd go to Tolbi and watch{3}Colosso. That's what{3}I'd do.{2}
That's a good idea. They{3}wouldn't let you into{3}Babi Lighthouse, anyway.{2}
Us? We're the soldiers{3}who guard the bridge{3}to Gondowan.{1}It's not like anyone's{3}ever going to attack{3}this bridge, though,{1}so there's not{3}much sense in{3}guarding it.{2}
Even if you head east,{3}you can't get to Kalay{3}from here, even!{1}A few reckless warriors{3}have tried, but none have{3}ever returned!{2}
Those who go to Gondowan{3}rarely go knowing what{3}it will be like.{1}I wouldn't even{3}think of going there.{2}
The warriors have been{3}fighting while we've{3}been guarding this{1}bridge. Being on duty{3}at a time like this is{3}plain old bad luck!{2}
You'd think you could{3}get through the cave{3}to the east...{1}But it's absolutely{3}impossible to get{3}through that cave.{2}
I won't stop you, but{3}I wouldn't go unless{3}I had business there!{2}
We missed all of Colosso{3}because we were stuck{3}guarding this bridge.{1}Sheesh... Talk about{3}unlucky!{2}
Why would Iodem choose{3}to wait for us in a{3}place like this?{1}I get nervous when{3}I feel like I'm{3}being watched.{2}
We haven't seen anybody{3}unusual crossing the{3}bridge today.{1}Come to think of it,{3}there was a group of six{3}strange-looking folk...{2}
Even if you go east{3}from here, you won't{3}end up in Kalay!{1}A few reckless warriors{3}have tried, but none{1}ever came back!{2}
I've been waiting for you,{3}{17}{1}! We should go to{3}Babi Lighthouse soon.{2}
Why are you going back,{3}{17}{1}?{1}Do you need to get{3}something you left{3}behind?{30}
I see... In that case,{3}I shall wait here for{3}you to return.{2}
Then we should continue{3}on our way to the{3}lighthouse.{2}
Iodem is going to Babi{3}Lighthouse? It must be{3}very near completion.{2}
It's a lot of stress, but{3}I'm a diligent worker, so{3}I can handle it.{1}Just act natural and{3}ignore Iodem... There's{3}nothing to worry about.{2}
Everyone comes down this{3}way when they find they{3}can't cross the Karagol.{1}They all have to try the{3}cave themselves, despite{3}what I tell them.{2}
We have to head for the{3}lighthouse quickly so we{3}can save Babi.{2}
There are many here who{3}want to return to Kalay{3}since Colosso is over.{1}But the ships won't{3}sail without the captain's{3}order.{2}
Hanging around here like{3}this and staring out at{3}the sea is boring!{2}
If both the captain and{3}Kaja say the ship's not{3}sailing, it's not.{2}
If Kaja and the others{3}say it's okay, I'd like to{3}head out to sea again.{2}
I'm stuck... I want to{3}cross the Karagol, but{3}the ships won't set sail.{2}
Yeah...the ship's not{3}going anywhere for{3}now.{1}Some rich guy was here{3}throwing money around,{3}but they still said no.{2}
The Karagol Sea looks so{3}calm from here. How can{3}it be dangerous?{2}
We've got passengers, but{3}nobody's sailing. How can{3}we sell any tickets?{2}
The captain must be a{3}stubborn man. With so{3}much money to be made,{1}I can't believe he won't{3}sail... Who cares how{3}dangerous it is?{2}
The marine-blue Karagol{3}Sea is such a romantic{3}sight to behold!{1}It really takes me back,{3}and I get all sentimental.{3}{9}{4}Sniff...{7}{2}
I returned the cost of{3}your ticket to you.{3}Let's leave it at that.{2}
Why should I, when all{3}you did was give me{3}what's mine!?{2}
Isn't the tour group{3}responsible for getting{3}us back to Kalay?{2}
With the road blocked and{3}the ships stuck here, we{3}have no way to get home.{2}
You brought us all here!{3}Take responsibility for{3}it! Responsibility!{2}
Must you really resort{3}to violence?{2}
What are you{24}{2}
I was hired for just{3}this sort of thing...{2}
You mean, you hired{3}{5}a bodyguard?{2}
Yeah! Because of rabble-{3}rousing customers like{3}you!{2}
We've asked this nice man{3}to act as a guard...for{3}everyone's safety.{2}
What are you talking{3}about?{2}
I wouldn't go any{3}farther than that if I{3}were you!{2}
Ge{5}-Get outta my way!{2}
Sorry, but I was hired{3}to BE in your way!{3}Please. Let it go...{2}
This is ridiculous!{2}
I know... And after I{3}asked him so nicely...{2}
You're wasting time on{3}this!? Why don't you find{3}a way to get us home?{2}
Tour groups should take{3}care of you from start{3}to finish, but...{1}it's not our fault the{3}ship won't sail, so we{3}can't offer any refunds.{2}
To heck with you! I'm{3}staying right here until{3}the ship leaves!{2}
Sigh. I wonder when{3}we'll be able to{3}return to Kalay.{2}
We'll be counting on you{3}if something comes up{3}again, Master.{2}
As long as we're stuck{3}here, I might as well make{3}some cash as a bodyguard.{2}
Sigh. If I knew it would{3}turn out like this, we{3}wouldn't have come.{2}
If they'd just let the ship{3}sail, the passengers{3}would stop complaining.{2}
If I'm going to be stuck{3}here, I should find work{3}and make some money.{2}
Grrr! Why don't you get{3}up off your back and do{3}something!{2}
As long as you're here,{3}we can stay without being{3}yelled at!{2}
This tour wasn't well{3}organized. That's why I{3}have to provide security.{1}I have conflicting{3}feelings about protecting{3}them.{2}
I wonder if Grandma is{3}doing okay now...{2}
Hey, hey! Who are you!{2}
That's strange. I've been{3}on watch this whole time,{3}so how did you get here?{2}
Regardless, no one{3}is allowed in!{2}
That's right. No one is{3}allowed in! Off with you{3}now! Off, I say!{2}
Who are you?{2}
How did you get in here?{2}
No matter! You're on{3}your way out now!{2}
And don't come back!{2}
Huh? I could swear I{3}just heard someone!{2}
You're crazy! Still, this{3}place {9}{2}is{7} kind of creepy.{3}I never did like it here!{2}
Ain't nobody gettin' in!{1}I don't even know why{3}we have to stay on guard{3}all the time.{2}
Hammet, the great{3}merchant of Kalay, is our{3}best source of income.{1}I will keep you safe{3}no matter what happens.{2}
Z-z-z-z Z-z-z-z-z...{3}It's so warm today! My{3}eyes are getting heavy.{2}
Dodonpa's orders are{3}absolute!{1}No one will ever get{3}by me and into the{3}fortress!{2}
Sigh. It's too bad I{3}couldn't go to Tolbi{3}this year.{1}I wonder how Colosso{3}turned out.{2}
That's strange!? I could{3}swear there's someone{3}right nearby...!{1}Maybe it's just{3}'cause I'm so tired.{2}
I'll take care of{3}anybody that might{3}show up!{2}
I was told to stand{3}guard, so I am{5}, but I'm{3}actually a coward!{1}I'm serious! I just{3}hope no one shows{3}up on my watch.{2}
Who is disrupting{3}my sleep???{2}
Who is disrupting{3}my sleep???{2}
Who is disrupting{3}my sleep???{2}
Hey! Intruder!{2}
You think you're{3}going any farther?{2}
Sorry, but you're gonna{3}have to fight your{3}way through.{2}
Huh? Who's that?{2}
You're pretty bold to{3}come charging into{3}a den of thieves.{2}
But your luck ran out{3}when you ran into me!{3}Show me your stuff!{2}
Is my shift up{3}already?{2}
...Wait a minute!{3}Who are you?{2}
I've never seen you{3}before! Intruder!{2}
Come on! You'll have{3}to deal with me!{2}
You scoundrel!{2}
Dodonpa always said you'd{3}come, and here you are!{2}
If I stop you here,{3}Dodonpa will finally{3}reward me!{2}
What a stroke of luck!{3}My time has finally come!{2}
Poor, poor Donpa.{3}Dodonpa's behavior is{3}driving him into despair.{1}Donpa can't last much{3}longer like this...{2}
Nearly all of these women{3}were brought here{3}against their will, like me.{1}Sigh. I want to go back{3}to my hometown just{3}one more time.{2}
Wh{5}-Wh{5}-Who goes there!{2}
Wh{5}-Who are you?{2}
You don't look nearly{3}as mean as the thieves{3}in the fortress.{2}
Did you sneak into Lunpa{3}Fortress in search of{3}something?{30}
The great merchant{3}Hammet? I'd tell you{3}if I knew, but I don't.{2}
Who would sneak into{3}such a dangerous{3}place just for fun?{2}
I won't tell anyone, but{3}you should leave before{3}the guards find you.{2}
Maybe that merchant is{3}the reason they've closed{3}off the lower caves...{2}
If Donpa dies, Dodonpa{3}will be even more...{1}I get scared just{3}thinking about it.{2}
I know Donpa would let{3}us go if he were well...{1}I hope he gets{3}better soon!{2}
Who are you!?{2}
Could this be the guy{3}who's come to get{3}Hammet back?{2}
Yeah! I bet he is!{2}
What a bold rascal!{2}
Dodonpa will be livid{3}if we lose Hammet!{2}
We're really going to be{3}in for it if we let{3}these kids get away.{2}
You're not going any{3}farther! Not without some{3}serious bruises, anyway!{2}
You guys are tougher than{3}we thought{24}we'll let{3}you go this time.{1}Get outta here.{2}
All right, all right.{3}We give up! If you're{3}here for Hammet,{1}he's down in the{3}cave! Go get{3}him already!{2}
Owww! Hey! Don't hurt{3}me again, you{3}thieving scoundrel!{1}I hate your guts. Go down{3}to the cave and save{3}your precious Hammet.{2}
Who'd have thought they'd{3}be so tough? We never{3}shoulda fought 'em.{2}
Hammet's down in that{3}treacherous cave.{1}They won't be able{3}to save him, though...{3}They'll see.{2}
At least those punks{3}won't find the switch{3}that opens the door.{1}Heh heh! It's hidden too{3}well in the wall!{2}
Donpa is supposed to be{3}old. I wonder what he's{3}fighting with in the{1}fortress.{1}That's why he's been in{3}poor form and spends his{3}time resting. What are{1}you going to do?{2}
Where could Dodonpa be?{3}He's not in his room,{3}but he couldn't have left.{2}
Whee! Thanks to Hammet{3}we can enjoy food{3}and drink all day long!{2}
With Hammet here, we can{3}milk as much money as{3}we want out of Kalay.{1}He's a money tree for{3}us, hic!{2}
Is there anyone in the{3}fortress who can face{3}Donpa in battle?{1}No one is allowed into{3}the cave to find out.{2}
Dodonpa's wife was{3}looking for him, but she{3}can't find him anywhere.{2}
We can eat all we like!{3}It was all bought with{3}the money from Kalay!{1}I love gorging myself{3}for free!{2}
As long as we have{3}Hammet, all of Kalay's{3}earnings will be ours.{2}
Z-z-z-z... Z-z-z-z...{2}
Father...I'm so sorry{3}about Dodonpa.{1}Someone will teach{3}him a lesson someday.{2}
Shhh! Please don't{3}wake Donpa!{2}
He's been driven to{3}despair after battling{3}a terrible foe.{2}
It is all because{3}of that Dodonpa!{2}
Are you the one{5} who{3}Donpa said would come{3}to punish Dodonpa?{30}
Donpa has waited a{3}very long time for you.{2}
Oh, you're not? Well...can{3}you do it anyway?{3}Someone has to do it!{2}
Donpa knows that he{3}coddled Dodonpa too{3}much as a child.{2}
It pains him so much.{3}He can't die with things{3}the way they are.{2}
Maybe if Dodonpa's eyes{3}are opened, Lunpa will{3}be a good place again.{2}
If someone would punish{3}Dodonpa, I'm sure Donpa{3}would offer a reward.{1}He might even give{3}that person Dodonpa's{3}ill-gotten goods.{2}
Do you know where{3}Dodonpa is?{30}
Really? That's fine,{3}as long as he's in the{3}fortress.{2}
Sigh. Don't tell me he's{3}gone off, trying to{3}relive his youth again...{1}I take my eyes off him{3}for a minute, and he's off{3}chasing a new sweetheart.{2}
Papa misbehaves and{3}makes Mama worry.{1}I have to be good{3}so Mama won't have{3}to worry so much.{2}
Papa always gets friendly{3}with the ladies when{3}Mama's not lookin'.{1}That's why Mama always{3}keeps a sharp eye on{3}Papa.{2}
Dodonpa's child is so well{3}behaved, I can't believe{3}he's his father's son!{1}It's a pity that child{3}can't have an{3}innocent childhood.{2}
We've already decided{3}that Donpappa will be{3}Dodonpa's successor!{1}At least that tradition{3}won't change!{2}
When my Papa's gone, I,{3}Donpappa, shall protect{3}Lunpa myself.{2}
I'm not going to marry{3}anyone like my Papa{3}when I grow up!{2}
Being watched by Donpappa{3}makes me feel like I'm{3}being judged.{2}
{17}{1} pulled the{3}switch.{2}
Is it time to eat?{2}
...Who are you?{2}
Hammet...{2}
{17}{3}, is that you?{2}
These people... Are{3}they friends of yours?{2}
Then it would appear your{3}journey has begun,{3}{17}{3}.{2}
I am a little late,{3}but I have come to{3}save you.{2}
You shouldn't have risked{3}yourself, {17}{3}.{2}
Hold it right there!{2}
Dodonpa!{2}
Sorry to interrupt your{3}teary little reunion,{3}Hammet!{2}
This must be your little{3}rat, {17}{3}{24}you always did{3}claim he'd rescue you!{2}
Look at him.{3}He's just a child!{2}
But to think these kids{3}could get this far!{2}
Hey, yeah! If we're just{3}kids, what does that{3}make your pathetic thugs?{2}
What kind of scum takes{3}ransom money and then{3}doesn't free his hostage?{2}
I see. So, you've been{3}extorting money from{3}Layana, have you?{2}
Now that we've found{3}Hammet, we'll be taking{3}him home!{2}
I'm afraid I can't let{3}you do that.{2}
Hammet is what I like to{3}call my little money{3}tree.{2}
You dirty scoundrel!{2}
Name-calling won't help{3}you! I'm not giving{3}Hammet up!{2}
Dodonpa pulled a lever.{2}
This little trap here{3}marks the end of your{3}good fortune!{2}
Prepare to become{3}monster fodder!{2}
Back for more? I guess{3}you didn't learn your{3}lesson!{2}
Dodonpa pulled a lever.{2}
Go ahead-keep trying!{3}You'll never win!{2}
Prepare to become{3}monster fodder!{2}
Uhnn! Get it off me!{2}
How did Dodonpa get{3}trapped under the{3}monster?{2}
He tried to pull{3}another dirty trick{3}on you!{2}
When Dodonpa saw his{3}monster was losing, he{3}tried to get behind you.{2}
Just a second longer, and{3}you'd have been history!{2}
You dirty snake!{2}
Dodonpa, you are{3}rotten to the core!{2}
Yeah, OK! I'm {9}{2}sorry{7}!{3}Now, get this thing{3}off of me!{2}
"Get this thing{3}off of me"!?{2}
I don't know. That thing{3}looks awfully heavy{3}for us kids to lift.{2}
What should we do,{3}{17}{1}? Should we try{3}to move it?{30}
I agree.{1}What do you think,{3}Hammet?{2}
I think we have to{3}try, at least.{2}
There. You should be{3}able to get up now!{2}
I... I can't.{2}
Did you break your{3}leg or something?{2}
It's not broken...{5}{3}I should be able to{3}stand after a bit.{2}
Thank goodness...{2}
What do you mean,{3}"thank goodness"!?{2}
Didn't he just{3}try to kill us?{2}
Can't we just forgive{3}and forget?{2}
Dodonpa kidnapped{3}you, remember!?{2}
Oh, that's right...{2}
Get a grip, you guys!{2}
But Hammet is safe now,{3}isn't he?{2}
Yeah, but do you really{3}think Dodonpa will reform{3}if Hammet forgives him?{2}
Hmm... I wonder...{2}
How about it, Dodonpa?{2}
He already said{3}he wouldn't do anything!{2}
Of course, he's going{3}to say that! He wants{3}us to forgive him!{2}
What do you think we{3}should do with him,{3}{17}{2}?{2}
We should lock him up{3}here, just like he did{3}to Hammet.{2}
No! How can you{3}be so cruel!{2}
Oh? And yet you have{3}no problem being that{3}cruel to Hammet!{2}
What should we do,{3}{17}{1}? Should we{3}lock Dodonpa up?{30}
Serves the little{3}punk right!{2}
Just leave him here{3}like this for a while!{2}
Dad!{2}
Dodonpa... You{5} pitiful{3}wretch.{2}
I always told you that{3}if you did evil to{3}others...{1}others would do evil{3}to you.{2}
You must right all of{3}the misdeeds you've{3}done!{2}
I feel bad for spoiling{3}you. Look at the{3}trouble it has caused...{2}
See! It's all your fault{3}that all this happened!{2}
Yes, which is why this{3}is going to hurt you{3}more than it does me!{2}
You're not serious,{3}are you, Dad?{2}
I most certainly am!{2}
You're going to spend some{3}time here thinking about{3}all that you've done!{2}
Dodonpa has caused you{3}all sorts of trouble,{3}hasn't he?{2}
No, not at all!{2}
I must apologize deeply{3}for all of this.{2}
Thank you, Donpa,{3}but you do not{3}need to apologize.{2}
Then you{5} forgive me?{2}
I am sorry about the{3}trouble, but I do have{3}one request.{2}
A request?{2}
I don't know how you{3}got in here, but please{3}leave by the same means.{2}
Huh? Donpa, didn't you{3}just say you're going{3}to lock up Dodonpa?{2}
So we shouldn't{3}have to sneak around,{3}should we?{2}
Some of Dodonpa's{3}henchmen are still{3}loyal to him.{2}
I'm ashamed to say it,{3}but they won't listen{3}to any of my orders.{2}
This new gang of thieves{3}will attack Hammet if they{3}find him in the fortress.{2}
And they may come to{3}check his cell, right?{2}
I see. Then they'd free{3}Dodonpa, wouldn't they?{2}
And then he'd head{3}straight for Kalay{3}seeking his revenge!{2}
I see. Yes, you're{3}right.{2}
It would be terrible{3}if Kalay were attacked.{2}
That's why you must{3}go while you still{3}can!{2}
You mean immediately?{2}
I heard of your intrusion,{3}so I spread some rumors{3}through the fortress.{2}
Rumors?{2}
I said brigands had snuck{3}in to kidnap Hammet, but{3}failed and ran off.{2}
Why in the world did{3}you do that?{2}
Now, they won't let{3}anyone down here{3}at all.{1}Plus, many of Dodonpa's{3}men have left to find{3}the intruders.{2}
Donpa, you are a{3}shrewd one!{2}
I just thought I'd{3}try to help however{3}I could...{2}
With Dodonpa's henchmen{3}gone, this is our{3}chance to escape, right?{30}
Why did I even bother{3}asking? Let's get{3}a move on!{2}
The next time you meet{3}Dodonpa, he will be a{3}changed man.{2}
I get it already! I{3}won't do anything wrong!{3}Come on, let me go!{2}
{17}{1}! Don't be stupid!{3}We can't go in there,{3}remember?{2}
A large contingent of{3}Dodonpa's henchmen have{3}left the fortress.{2}
It's gotten colder...{3}I'm shiverin' just{3}standin' here.{2}
They say there were{3}intruders in the{3}fortress.{1}Just daring to try{3}such a thing is{3}impressive!{2}
Do you want to know what{3}caused the commotion{3}at the fortress?{30}
Someone snuck into the{3}fortress to save the{3}merchant Hammet!{1}In the end, they{3}failed, so they just{3}ran away.{2}
They're foolhardy to{3}invade such a well-{3}guarded fortress!{1}But it would be pretty{3}neat if they got away{3}with it.{2}
Dodonpa's henchmen have{3}gotten their share{3}of bumps and bruises!{1}They've been acting{3}real tough, lately, but{3}they're nothing special.{2}
Apparently, Donpa told{3}Dodonpa's henchmen{3}about the intruders.{1}I guess when it comes{3}right down to it, Donpa{3}is on Dodonpa's side.{2}
They say that Dodonpa's{3}henchmen were defeated.{1}Hearing that makes me{3}feel like all my problems{3}have washed away!{2}
The fortress was under{3}strict guard.{1}Just who were those{3}people that snuck{3}inside?{2}
Don't come any closer{3}to the fortress!{2}
I've seen that man{3}with you before.{2}
Nah, that's impossible.{3}I must be thinking of{3}somebody else.{2}
How did the warriors{3}from Kalay get into{3}the fortress?{1}Man, did we get in{3}trouble for that!{2}
I'm sure I've seen{3}that man with them{3}before!{2}
I wonder what Dodonpa's{3}henchmen are up to?{2}
Look how far winter{3}has come already!{2}
Whoever snuck into the{3}fortress is in for some{3}trouble. Poor guys.{2}
I'm amazed anyone could{3}sneak into such a well-{3}guarded fortress!{2}
It's really funny to see{3}Dodonpa's henchmen{3}in such a panic!{2}
No matter how evil he is,{3}he's still Donpa's son.{1}I guess Donpa would{3}still do anything for{3}Dodonpa, huh?{2}
I was so mad when{3}Dodonpa's thugs took my{3}candy away.{2}
That is the only way into{3}or out of the fortress.{1}I don't see how anyone{3}could get in there{3}without being seen.{2}
Hmmm. That guy who's{3}following them sure{3}looks like that merchant.{1}But I only caught a{3}glimpse of him, so{3}I'm not real sure.{2}
I don't get it. We were{3}on guard the whole time!{3}Nobody got by us!{2}
Apparently, a traveling{3}merchant stopped by on{3}business recently.{1}He wasn't allowed{3}into the village,{3}of course.{2}
The merchant who comes{3}every winter was the{3}one arguing at the gate.{1}Sigh. I'd like to buy{3}something, but no one's{3}allowed into the village!{2}
That poor merchant.{3}They won't let him into{3}the village now.{2}
That's one stubborn{3}merchant.{1}He's still hanging{3}around the outskirts{3}of town.{2}
I saw a strange,{3}shimmering creature go{3}into the fortress.{1}Do you know{3}what it was?{2}
I don't care what they{3}say, I don't believe it!{1}A shimmering creature{3}going into the{3}fortress!?{2}
Could that shimmering{3}beast be the cause{3}of all the commotion?{2}
Monsters hardly ever{3}come into town.{1}Now, they expect me to{3}believe one snuck into{3}the fortress?{2}
What!? The eruption of{3}Mt. Aleph released{3}hordes of monsters?{1}I get the feeling things{3}are going to get worse{3}before they get better.{2}
Gramps has been really{3}cryptic lately.{1}He told me Mt. Aleph's{3}eruption was an omen of{3}a great flood. I hate that!{2}
I heard hordes of{3}monsters appeared right{3}before the great flood.{1}I hope the recent{3}troubles aren't a sign{3}of another flood!{2}
Great floods don't{3}happen every day,{3}you know!{2}
The end is near! Doom is{3}upon us! To arms!{3}To arms!{1}Once they're gone, they're{3}gone, so buy 'em{3}while they last!{2}
All those weapons, but I{3}doubt Dodonpa's henchmen{3}can use them!{2}
What do you think?{3}I've got some incredible{3}products here, huh?{1}Buy whatever you like!{2}
Once I sell this armor,{3}I'm closing shop...{3}It's kind of a pity...{2}
The weapons and armor{3}vendors are looking{3}desperate.{1}The stuff they're{3}selling now is the last{3}of their stock.{2}
It isn't just the weapons{3}vendors whose inventory{3}is falling!{1}We're almost out of{3}products too!{2}
Do you want rest in{3}our inn?{30}
I see. In that case,{3}go ahead and stay.{3}I won't ask why.{2}
Well, do as you like.{1}Feel free to stay here{3}anytime you like.{2}
Are you Donpa's guest?{30}
So, you're the one we{3}were told to give the{3}royal treatment to!{1}Oh, you're supposed to{3}visit Donpa again once{3}the guests have left.{2}
Really, you're not?{3}Well, then, who is Donpa's{3}guest?{2}
What's with the boss?{1}He told me to air out the{3}guest-room bedding and{3}change the sheets.{2}
I just gave the boss a{3}letter Dodonpa sent from{3}the fortress.{1}Now, suddenly, he wants me{3}to start cooking up a storm.{3}Are we expecting guests?{2}
I guess some really{3}important guests of{3}Donpa's are coming.{1}All I know is five young{3}warriors are coming,{3}but I've never met them.{2}
I can't imagine Donpa's{3}guests being anyone{3}but these folks.{1}If they don't show up,{3}all my work will have{3}been for nothing!{2}
With the village closed,{3}I wonder if those guests{3}will even come.{2}
I heard Donpa was sick,{3}but he seemed to be{3}in pretty good shape.{2}
A number of Dodonpa's{3}men set out not too{3}long ago.{1}I wonder what sort of{3}evil deeds they'll{3}perpetrate this time.{2}
Please strike down{3}Dodonpa's henchmen with{3}a bolt from the blue...{1}Oh no! I'm supposed to be{3}spreading good will,{1}but now I've gone and{3}cursed them.{2}
Lunpa Fortress is a{3}mass of confusion{3}right now.{1}If you don't want to get{3}hurt, be off with{3}you! Be off now!{2}
They never let the{3}merchants come into{3}the village!{1}I don't know you guys{3}from Adam! You think I'm{3}going to let you in?{2}
These guys couldn't be{3}the ones that got into the{3}fortress, could they?{1}This lazy-looking{3}mug? No way!{2}
That merchant was{3}desperate to do{3}business in the village.{1}I'm sure he's around{3}somewhere, but I doubt{3}he's causin' any trouble!{2}
I think I saw someone{3}just now.{2}
Yeah. I saw{3}something, too.{2}
Do you think Dodonpa's{3}henchmen have found us?{30}
If they have, we'll have{3}to take care of them{3}right now!{2}
Huh? You think there's{3}something else out there!?{2}
Just a moment!{2}
Is that you, Bunza?{2}
Gasp! That voice!{2}
It's Hammet!{2}
So, Dodonpa never had{3}any intention of{3}releasing Hammet?{2}
That's right. That's why{3}{17}{3} and his friends{3}came to the rescue!{2}
Once {17}{1} made up his{3}mind, we all decided{3}to come save Hammet.{2}
Hey, {17}{3}! Are you{3}saying this was all{3}{17}{1}'s idea?{2}
N-No! I mean, you and{3}{17}{4} helped us, too!{2}
Thank you, {17}{1},{3}{17}{2}, and {17}{4}.{2}
And, of course, you,{3}too, {17}{3}!{2}
You sure did a good{3}job finding this cave,{3}Bunza.{2}
Yes! Impressive work{3}you did, Bunza!{2}
It was pure{3}coincidence.{2}
I really didn't want to{3}come to Lunpa.{2}
Because we knew the{3}thieves had Hammet{3}imprisoned...{2}
Then why did you come{3}here?{2}
I recalled what Hammet{3}told me about being{3}a successful merchant.{2}
Really? He told you{3}that you should start{3}trading in Lunpa?{2}
No, I meant his more{3}general words of wisdom...{2}
"Merchants must not{3}judge customers on their{3}appearances."{2}
"Do not avoid a place{3}just because something{3}unpleasant may happen."{2}
"As long as customers{3}await your goods,{1}you must do everything{3}in your power to sell{3}to them!"{2}
So, you came to serve the{3}villagers, even though{3}you despised Dodonpa?{2}
Fate put this opportunity{3}before you.{2}
But why did you think a{3}Kalay merchant would be{3}permitted into Lunpa?{2}
I didn't. And, in fact,{3}they would not let me in.{2}
Yet, knowing that, you{3}still came?{2}
But you know what?{3}There was that huge{3}commotion, right?{2}
He must mean the{3}activity caused by{3}Donpa's rumors!{2}
It all came together{3}for me... That commotion{3}was related to Hammet!{2}
I had to find out what{3}was going on...{2}
And that's how you{3}found this cave?{2}
I'll bet you couldn't{3}find any way to get that{3}gate open from this side.{2}
But then all of a sudden,{3}it moved, so I hid{3}behind a rock.{2}
We startled you, didn't{3}we, Bunza?{2}
I am just glad you{3}were able to get Hammet{3}out safely!{2}
Why do you say it{3}like that, Bunza?{2}
Dodonpa's henchmen have{3}been combing the area...{2}
Even if they aren't after{3}Hammet, if they find him...{2}
They might capture{3}Hammet again! Let's get{3}out of here, quickly!{2}
But we have to escape{3}without being seen by{3}Dodonpa's henchmen...{2}
What should we do,{3}{17}{1}? Should we{3}stay and fight?{30}
Saving Hammet from that{3}fortress was dangerous{3}enough...{2}
Taking them all on is{3}more foolhardy than{3}invading their fortress.{2}
Then what should we{3}do, Bunza?{2}
I have a wagon nearby.{2}
A wagon?{2}
That's right. Let's all{3}go back to Kalay in my{3}wagon.{2}
Won't a wagon stand out?{3}If it were searched by{3}Dodonpa's henchmen...{2}
There's no need to worry.{3}I've been here since{3}before the commotion.{2}
Right. They've already{3}seen your wagon around...{2}
That's correct, {17}{2}.{3}They don't suspect me{3}of being involved!{2}
Then let's take that{3}wagon to Kalay!{2}
Should we ride in the{3}wagon, too?{30}
Huh? You don't want to{3}ride in Bunza's wagon?{30}
So, what? You've changed{3}your mind? You do want{3}to go with them?{30}
Now I'm totally confused.{3}You changed your mind{3}again?{2}
Stop wasting our time!{3}Are we riding in the{3}wagon?{30}
Do you have some{3}unfinished business{3}in Lunpa?{30}
If you insist, then I'll{3}stick with you!{2}
Hey... I can't leave you{3}two here by yourselves!{3}I'll stay behind, too.{2}
Hammet, I'm going to go{3}with {17}{1}, too.{2}
Yes, {17}{3}, you should{3}accompany your friends{3}on this mission.{2}
I'm disappointed we can't{3}travel home together,{3}but I understand.{1}Be careful, {17}{3}!{2}
Sigh. They've gone!{2}
I hope Hammet and Bunza{3}make it to Kalay safely.{2}
They'll be okay. I'm{3}sure they'll make it{3}there in one piece.{2}
Well. Let's get going{3}ourselves, {17}{1}!{3}We're off!{2}
Do you have any{3}unfinished business?{30}
If you don't have any{3}unfinished business, then{3}let's get on to Kalay!{2}
Lady Layana will be{3}so happy, won't she?{2}
Yes. I'd like to see{3}her as soon as{3}possible.{2}
Then, let's set off!{2}
Are you saying you still{3}have some things to do{3}here in Lunpa? {30}
Don't startle me! You{3}don't have anything{3}left to do, do you? {30}
Meaning...you won't ride{3}in the wagon?{2}
I am sorry, {17}{1}, but{3}I cannot safely wait{3}here any longer.{2}
So...do you intend{3}to stay and finish{3}your business?{30}
Thank you for your help{3}with Dodonpa.{2}
I have a little something{3}for you, for your teaching{3}Dodonpa his lesson.{2}
Give these people a{3}token of my gratitude.{2}
Deep within there is an{3}interesting creature that{3}I fought once long ago.{2}
I give this to you.{3}Please take good care{3}of it.{2}
Donpa is very grateful{3}for what you have{3}done.{2}
Well, now I'm worried{3}about Dodonpa really{3}turning over a new leaf!{2}
It must be difficult{3}for Donpa right now.{1}It's so hard to teach{3}a child a lesson.{2}
What father can stay{3}angry at his children{3}for long?{1}Actually, I'd like to{3}free Dodonpa from his{3}cell right now.{2}
The merchant from Kalay{3}is in here somewhere.{3}He's not going anywhere.{2}
Actually, Dodonpa's in{3}here, but only a few{3}people know that.{1}As long as we're on{3}guard, no one will find{3}out.{2}
I was wrong! I'll turn{3}over a new leaf, Dad!{3}Please forgive me!{2}
I can't believe what you{3}did to me! When I get out{3}of here,{5} I'll get you all!{2}
The key doesn't work.{3}Maybe Donpa changed{3}the locks.{2}
We've arrived, Hammet.{2}
Arrived where?{2}
Oh, didn't I tell you about{3}this entrance, {17}{3}?{2}
This underground passage{3}leads to Hammet Palace.{2}
An{5} underground{5} passage?{5}{3}What for?{2}
Just to be safe.{2}
I don't understand.{3}Why bring the wagon in{3}this way?{2}
Because Dodonpa's{3}henchmen may be{3}here in Kalay...{2}
Well then, Bunza, would{3}you please take them{3}to the town's entrance?{2}
What?{5} Why? We'll just go{3}this way with you.{2}
You can't. You must go{3}through town to the{3}Palace.{2}
I'm confused...{2}
You have no reason to{3}hide, now, do you?{2}
Why shouldn't we just{3}go in this way?{2}
That would raise{3}suspicions.{2}
Wouldn't it be strange if{3}people who aren't even{3}supposed to be in town...{1}suddenly walked out{3}of the Palace?{2}
If anyone noticed, they{3}might learn of this{3}secret entrance.{2}
Now, do you understand?{30}
In that case how{3}about this?{2}
I think Hammet and Lady{3}Layana need time for{3}their reunion...{2}
In that case, we will{3}gladly ride in the wagon.{2}
Do you want to go to{3}the cave up ahead?{30}
I'd like to let you go, but{3}I cannot. You'd better{3}just turn around.{2}
Good, because I wouldn't{3}be able to let you{3}anyway.{2}
Hammet and Lady Layana{3}have commanded that none{3}shall pass through here.{2}
So! {5} It's {17}{3} and{3}his companions...{3}Perfect timing!{2}
So{5}, it's you...{2}
I told you time and time{3}again not to go to Lunpa,{3}but you went anyway.{2}
Please, Layana, don't be{3}so harsh on them.{2}
Naturally, I'm happy{3}that they rescued you.{2}
But this was something{3}that Kalay should have{3}handled alone.{2}
You had a more pressing{3}quest at hand, no?{30}
Yes.{5} Your mission is to{3}recover the Elemental{3}Stars.{2}
Have you completely{3}forgotten your own{3}quest!?{2}
Layana,{5} you shouldn't...{2}
I...{5} I had to rescue{3}Hammet,{5} no matter{3}the cost...{2}
It's already done.{3}There is nothing{3}more to be said.{2}
Hold on! We all wanted{3}to save Hammet as badly{3}as {17}{3} did.{2}
It doesn't matter,{3}{17}{2}. I'm the one{3}at fault!{2}
I made a mistake.{3}We will leave immediately{3}on {17}{5}'s trail!{2}
Yes. That would be best.{3}Leave immediately.{2}
{17}{1}, we should be{3}going.{2}
{17}{3}, is that really{3}what you want?{2}
Well, if {17}{3} says so...{3}Should we go,{3}{17}{1}?{30}
If both {17}{1} and{3}{17}{3} want to leave,{3}then I guess that's it.{2}
Take your Shaman's Rod{3}and go to Hesperia.{2}
To Hesperia...?{2}
That is what the Jupiter{3}Adept said.{2}
Hesperia...{3}Where is that?{2}
It is the continent{3}to the west of{3}Angara.{2}
What are we going to{3}find in Hesperia if{3}we go?{2}
That, I do not know...{2}
The continent to the{3}west? On the other side{3}of the sea?{2}
Do not waste time{3}chattering. You must set{3}out immediately.{2}
Take your Shaman's Rod{3}and set out for{3}Hesperia.{1}And...{5}be careful.{2}
No one in Kalay knows{3}Hammet has returned.{1}We will have to hide{3}Hammet in the Palace for{3}quite a while.{2}
I hear Hammet was saved{3}by you people...{3}Thank you so much!{2}
They say Hammet's return{3}is supposed to be{3}a secret for now.{1}The villagers are worried,{3}so I'd like to tell them,{3}but we can't...{2}
I left the door to the{3}underground passage{3}open, so go have a look.{2}
I wonder if any of{3}Dodonpa's thugs{5} have come{3}here after Hammet...{1}That is the only thing{3}that really has me{3}frightened.{2}
The secret passage is{3}locked because Hammet's{3}treasure is in there.{2}
Layana's words pain her{3}more than they can know.{1}Surely, {17}{1} and{3}his friends understand{3}Layana's feelings.{2}
I'm so happy Hammet made{3}it back safely, I could{3}cry...{1}{17}{1}, {17}{3}...{3}We all must thank you.{2}
I'm so relieved Hammet{3}made it back safely.{2}
I can't let on to the{3}townspeople when I{3}speak to them!{2}
Layana ordered the door{3}to the underground{3}path opened.{1}This represents our{3}gratitude toward {17}{1}{3}and his friends{1}...for saving Hammet.{2}
We will never let{3}Dodonpa's henchmen get{3}Hammet again...{2}
The key to the secret{3}passage is also the key to{3}Hammet's treasure room.{2}
Layana was very hard{3}on all of you, wasn't{3}she?{30}
I think she went too{3}far, telling you all{3}to leave...{1}But she is the one who{3}most regrets parting{3}with {17}{3}.{2}
Her words were hard,{3}but you know how painful{3}they were for her to say.{1}Layana will be very{3}happy to hear that.{2}
The things beyond these{3}doors belong to you all.{3}Please take them!{2}
This is Suhalla.{1}Don't try crossing the{3}desert. The sandstorms{3}are too fierce.{2}
Are you trying to get{3}to Lalivero?{30}
Making it through the{3}sandstorms is impossible.{3}Don't bother.{2}
Didn't you come from{3}Angara?{1}Anytime Angarans come{3}to Suhalla, they're always{3}going to Lalivero.{2}
We Gondowans will never{3}trust anyone from{3}Angara! You know why?{1}{17}{7}, the holy child of{3}Lalivero, was taken away{3}as a hostage to Tolbi.{2}
It has been said for ages{3}that desert spirits only{3}create sandstorms...{1}when they are angry.{2}
You can't get to southern{3}Gondowan from here,{3}can you?{1}There are many natural{3}obstacles. There is no{3}way to cross them.{2}
The workers say there're{3}huge festivals in Tolbi.{3}I'd like to see one.{2}
The sandstorms suddenly{3}increased...{1}I hope no one gets{3}caught in one and{3}gets injured.{2}
The Suhalla has long been{3}known for its sandstorms.{3}There are too many now.{2}
The people of Lalivero{3}have been worked hard by{3}Angara's soldiers.{1}No one would dare make{3}Suhallans work like that!{2}
The ruler of Tolbi took a{3}girl named {17}{7} hostage{3}to control Lalivero.{1}We'll never trust{3}anyone from Angara!{2}
I know the desert spirits{3}will exact their vengeance{3}on Babi for this.{2}
Southern Gondowan is{3}guarded by the{3}natural terrain.{1}We are constantly{3}worried about an{3}invasion from Angara...{2}
I've heard that Tolbi's{3}Colosso is a{3}warriors' festival, but...{1}I wonder what a{3}warriors' festival{3}is like...{2}
None of the grown-ups in{3}Suhalla go into the desert{3}during a sandstorm.{2}
My father loves people{3}so much, he can't help but{3}aid anyone in trouble.{1}But I love my father{3}despite his faults.{2}
Let me know if you{3}have any problems.{1}I'll do anything I{3}can to help.{2}
When I see people in{3}trouble, I just can't{3}sit still.{1}I guess I'm just{3}my father's child!{2}
I want to help people{3}so badly, I can't sit{3}idly by!{2}
Tolbi probably ignores{3}small villages like{3}Suhalla, doesn't it?{1}Now that I think about{3}it, that's probably for{3}the best.{2}
If you head east across{3}Suhalla, Lalivero is{3}so close you can see it{1}across the Nol River, but{3}you can't get across the{3}river delta.{2}
Suhalla is a desert{3}village. I guess it will{3}never be like Lalivero.{2}
Good thing it's not easy{3}to get to Lalivero!{1}If it were, Suhalla would{3}be completely{3}left behind.{2}
Ours is the only store{3}in Suhalla.{1}This is a small village,{3}so one store is enough.{2}
A village this small{3}can't support many{3}shops.{2}
Sigh. Nothin' to do...{1}Maybe we'll see business{3}once Tolbi's festival{3}ends.{2}
I wonder if any customers{3}can get through those{3}sandstorms...{1}First, they'd have to{3}want to cross through{3}the desert.{2}
Once the festival ends,{3}the travelers will head{3}for Lalivero.{1}If they just get caught{3}in the sandstorms, they'll{3}be my customers!{2}
For some reason, anyone{3}who gets caught in a{3}sandstorm winds up here.{1}They all give up trying{3}to cross the desert and{3}take shelter in Suhalla.{2}
I get sick thinking about{3}Lalivero being under{3}Tolbi's rule.{2}
The holy child, {17}{7},{3}will save those deluded{3}Laliverans.{1}That is what they{3}believe in Lalivero.{2}
Welcome to Suhalla. I{3}bet the sandstorms{3}were terrible...{2}
The desert is enveloped{3}in sandstorms! It's{3}frightening!{2}
Soldiers from Tolbi were{3}caught in the sandstorms,{3}and nearly all perished!{1}The survivors are in{3}that house.{2}
We were brought here{3}by the sandstorms. It{3}all happened so fast!{2}
This sandstorm is the{3}fault of the Angarans!{1}If you all hadn't built that{3}thing in Lalivero, the{3}spirits wouldn't be angry!{2}
You were brought to{3}Suhalla by the{3}sandstorm, right?{30}
Everyone who gets caught{3}in the sandstorms winds{3}up in Suhalla.{1}You should be glad you{3}weren't blown away to{3}some strange place!{2}
I don't care what anyone{3}says, there shouldn't{3}be so many sandstorms!{1}What in the world{3}could be going on in{3}the Suhalla desert?{2}
Why are the sandstorms{3}attacking humans?{1}It's as if the{3}sandstorms are{3}actually alive!{2}
Those soldiers kept{3}mumbling about monsters...{2}
I bet these warriors{3}were brought here by a{3}sandstorm.{2}
I wonder why there{3}are so many sandstorms?{1}It wasn't this bad{5}{3}until only recently.{2}
The soldiers from Tolbi{3}were collapsing, like{3}after a battle.{2}
After you get swallowed{3}by a sandstorm, you{3}have a few moments{1}before you get blown back{3}here, but still there's{3}nothing you can do...{2}
Lately, all the sandstorms{3}have been incredibly{3}fierce.{1}What could the desert{3}spirits be so angry{3}about?{2}
If you fight the storms,{3}you'll enrage the spirits,{3}and they'll take your life.{1}I bet that's what{3}happened to the{3}soldiers from Tolbi.{2}
Grown-ups say the{3}sandstorms attack people.{1}But, it doesn't make{3}sense that a storm would{3}attack anything!{2}
They say the soldiers{3}were ravaged by a{3}sandstorm...{1}but I think it must{3}have been a monster...{2}
The wounded are sleeping,{3}so don't raise your{3}voice!{2}
I am amazed these{3}soldiers survived their{3}wounds...{1}They must have been{3}in good shape!{2}
Iodem...{2}
You soldiers were{3}supposed to be heading{3}for Babi Lighthouse!{2}
Iodem... What are{3}you doing here?{2}
Babi ordered me to go to{3}the lighthouse with{3}{17}{1}.{2}
You were escorting {17}{7}{3}to Lalivero, no?{2}
We've disgraced Tolbi...{2}
What has happened to{3}{17}{7}? Where is {17}{7}!?{2}
I don't know. When we{3}awoke, we were here in{3}these beds.{2}
If anything has happened{3}to {17}{7}, what will{3}become of the lighthouse?{2}
{17}{7} was the sole{3}reason Lalivero aided{3}us in its construction.{2}
We entrusted you with{3}{17}{7} to speed up the{3}construction.{1}Was that a mistake?{2}
Iodem...{5} I know that, at{3}the very least, {17}{7}{3}wasn't in the sandstorm.{2}
Is this true!?{2}
{17}{7} was entrusted to{3}our care, so we shielded{3}her from any risk.{2}
You acted properly,{3}then, but where is{3}{17}{7} now?{2}
Probably not far from the{3}edge of the sandstorm{3}that hit us...{2}
{17}{1}, we must go to{3}the desert and find{3}{17}{7}.{2}
If you're going to the{3}desert...beware of{3}that cyclone!{2}
At first{5}, we couldn't{3}avoid getting caught{3}in the sandstorms.{2}
But there were others{3}who were able to make it{3}through the storms.{2}
Who knows how they got{3}it, but they used water{3}to stop the cyclones.{2}
Water? You can stop the{3}sandstorms with water...{2}
I think I understand.{3}Now get some rest...{2}
Wait, Iodem...{5} There is{3}more. You must not meet{3}our fate...{2}
The sandstorms{5} are{3}caused{5} by monsters.{2}
Can this be?{2}
The others...{5} They slayed{3}the beasts{5}... That's{3}how they got through.{2}
Wh{5}-Who{5}{24}what are they?{2}
When the storms stopped,{3}they would move ahead,{3}{5}but a new storm always...{2}
They had strange powers.{3}We had to bring barrels{5}{3}filled with water...{2}
But carrying the barrels{3}exhausted us...and then{5}{3}the beast...{2}
That's enough...{3}Get some rest!{2}
They are dangerous, those{3}others. Slay that beast{3}and take up the trail...{2}
Thank you for your help.{3}You have dispatched your{3}duties with honor.{2}
Could these others be{3}the ones you are{3}following, {17}{1}?{30}
You took the same{3}impression from their{3}tale as I did...{2}
I don't know why...{3}but that is the sense{3}I get from this tale...{2}
We must find {17}{7} as{3}quickly as we can!{2}
Then, we shall get through{3}the Suhalla and pursue{3}your opponents.{2}
Why were they headed{3}toward eastern{3}Gondowan?{1}I have a bad feeling about{3}this. Please! You must{3}overtake them...{2}
Where is {17}{7}...{3}What has happened{3}to {17}{7}?{2}
These old soldiers must{3}rest until their wounds{3}heal.{2}
Who could have done{3}this to such powerful{3}soldiers?{2}
A column of water shot{3}up when they were caught{3}in the sandstorm.{1}Then the sand was gone.{1}But it was so much more{3}water than we could ever{3}hold in our barrels...{2}
{17}{7} was not far{3}behind us. She should{3}still be safe.{1}{17}{7} must be in the{3}desert somewhere...{3}If not, maybe they...{2}
Do not approach the{3}large cyclones in the{3}middle of the Suhalla.{1}The Suhallans call those{3}death storms. They are{3}pure evil.{2}
Death storms, huh?{3}There was a saying about{3}those big cyclones...{1}Ummm, What...{3}What was it?{3}...I can't remember.{2}
Once you get swept up in{3}a death storm, you can{3}never be rescued.{1}Countless people are{3}missing because of{3}them.{2}
"Ye who seek..."{3}Something about eyes of{3}truth... What was it?{1}"When ye take thy{3}treasure, a creature of{3}darkness..."{1}Oh, fiddle-faddle.{3}I forget.{2}
Aren't you surprised{3}to find so few shops?{30}
I bet you are! Suhalla{3}is a small village...{3}Ours is the only shop!{1}We don't have anything{3}great, but feel free to{3}look around.{2}
It's really something{3}to have an equipment{3}shop...{2}
We've had more customers{3}lately because of the{3}increase in sandstorms.{2}
We've been busy ever{3}since the surge of{3}sandstorms!{1}We are happy about it,{3}but we feel bad for{3}the poor travelers.{2}
It will take time for the{3}storms to die down, so{3}make yourselves at home.{2}
We went into the Suhalla{3}to go build the lighthouse,{3}but the storms caught us.{1}Sigh. Now we can't{3}reach Babi Lighthouse.{2}
The sandstorms are so{3}bad, we've given up trying{3}to reach Babi Lighthouse.{2}
I suppose you folk were{3}blown here on your way{3}to Babi Lighthouse?{30}
If you follow the northern{3}mountain, you can get{3}back to Tolbi.{1}I'm giving up, too...{3}Let's head back{3}that way.{2}
I set out for Babi{3}Lighthouse to open{3}a business there,{1}but then I was blown{3}back here again!{2}
The sandstorms are{3}sending customers our{3}way!{1}I hope those winds keep{3}right on blowing!{2}
Please, great sandstorms!{3}Send us more{3}customers!{2}
Even if we can't go, it{3}won't affect construction{3}of the lighthouse much.{2}
So, shall we give up on{3}Babi Lighthouse and{3}head back to Tolbi?{2}
When that cyclone threw{3}us into the air, I thought{3}we were done for!{1}I'm happy just to be{3}alive!{2}
I wonder why we're{3}having all these{3}sandstorms...{2}
I shudder to think{3}sandstorms will get{3}me if I leave town.{2}
A sandstorm!{2}
There'll be trouble{3}if we get caught up{3}in one of those...{2}
But something is wrong...{3}Why are there so many?{2}
If we don't get past{3}here, we'll never make{3}it to Babi Lighthouse.{2}
We must step carefully{3}if we hope to escape{3}the desert.{2}
{17}{7} is nowhere to{3}be found.{2}
I wonder what{3}happened...{2}
Should we search the{3}desert once more or{3}press on to Lalivero?{2}
What do you say, {17}{1}?{3}Should we keep going?{30}
Ah, yes. I had forgotten{3}about your foes...{2}
But I must carry out{3}Babi's orders...{2}
Our guard gate{3}lies ahead.{2}
We can leave {17}{7} to{3}the soldiers at the{3}gate.{2}
Well, perhaps we should{3}head there first, then.{2}
Look at this!{2}
What happened?{2}
Babi's ship...{2}
Hm... Perhaps it{3}is time...{2}
{17}{1}{5}, take this...{3}Try to use it.{2}
You got the Black Orb.{2}
Now use it...{3}on the ship.{2}
{17}{1}, where you going?{3}I said to use the Orb{3}on Babi's ship!{2}
What's the matter?{2}
Strange... Nothing{3}happened. What does{3}it mean?{2}
Could Babi{5} have{3}been wrong?{2}
No. Not Babi...{2}
I was wrong{24}it is{3}not yet time.{1}We must press on to{3}Babi Lighthouse.{2}
I will take that back{5},{3}for now.{2}
You returned the{3}Black Orb.{2}
We will return to{3}the ship later.{2}
The wreckage of a ship{3}scuttled off the coast.{2}
Only those with travel{3}papers may pass through.{1}If you do not have them{3}you must turn back{3}at once.{2}
Do you want to go to{3}Babi Lighthouse?{30}
Show me your travel{3}papers, and I'll let{3}you pass!{2}
What! You don't have{3}travel papers? Then I{3}cannot let you pass!{2}
Hmmph!{5} You don't want{3}to see Babi Lighthouse?{3}You're a strange one!{2}
I never ask why I{3}must protect this{3}place!{1}I simply obey Babi's{3}orders...{2}
I wonder if this year's{3}Colosso is over yet...{1}Sigh. I'd like to see{3}Colosso next year...{2}
What is the meaning{3}of this!?{2}
Uh! {5}Is...{5}{3}Is that Iodem...?{2}
What has happened{3}to the gate?{2}
There was a strange{3}group... No papers...{3}They wanted to pass...{2}
Uhh... Io{5}dem...{2}
We tried to hold them{3}back...{5}but they were{3}too powerful!{2}
They{5} had strange{3}powers...{5} We were{3}no match for them.{2}
It must have been {17}{5}!{30}
Yeah... No one else{3}is capable of this.{2}
Don't you know the work{3}of your own foe's hand?{3}Who else could it be?{2}
After we find {17}{7},{3}we must track down the{3}monsters that did this.{2}
We must get to Babi{3}Lighthouse as soon as{3}possible!{2}
Yes{5}, but we cannot{3}leave the soldiers{3}like this...{2}
We're okay.{5} Don't worry{3}about us! Get after{3}them{5}, please...{2}
But that would be...{2}
We were bested in{3}battle, but we will{5}{3}survive...{5} Now go!{2}
If they have done anything{3}at the lighthouse...{3}It would be our...{2}
He's right. We've got{3}to stop them!{2}
We're going after them,{3}right, {17}{1}!{2}
Ohhh!{5} It's no use...{3}I don't think I can{3}get up.{1}Send help once you{3}reach Babi Lighthouse.{2}
It's a pity a Colosso{3}victor should end up{3}like this...{1}Next time I see them,{3}I'll be sure to settle{3}the score!{2}
Curses! It's a disgrace{3}to be seen by Iodem{3}like this...{1}I'd rather crawl into{3}a hole and hide.{2}
I thought I was dead!{3}I'm lucky even to be alive{3}right now...{1}The strange ones with the{3}wild hair... Their power{3}was too much for us.{2}
I have been traveling{3}the lands spreading{3}good will.{2}
Cliffs, deserts...{3}Gondowan is a desolate{3}wasteland.{2}
Venus Lighthouse was...{5}{3}attacked by{5} strange...{5}{5}{3}wanderers...{2}
Iodem, be{5} happy. The{3}entrance to Venus{3}Lighthouse is open...{1}After{5} years of study...{3}our dreams have{5} at{3}last come{5} true!{2}
Ohhh! How could they{3}attack mere scholars?{3}Those barbarians!{2}
I've waited so long to see{3}what it's like inside Venus{3}Lighthouse, but...{2}
I can't even move{3}without feeling terrible,{3}terrible pain.{2}
How... How did they{3}open the door to{3}Venus Lighthouse?{2}
They are already...{3}headed for{5} Babi{3}Lighthouse...{2}
Babi's soldiers are{3}all Colosso victors...{1}How could anyone beat{3}all of us?{3}Who were they?{2}
Uhnnn... If only I could{3}move...{1}The lighthouse is open{3}at last, but{5}{5} at what{3}cost?{2}
Their powers were so...{3}strange...{3}Who were they...?{2}
I must get inside{5}{3}Venus Lighthouse... Must{3}find the connection...{2}
The young boy seemed to{3}glow for an instant...{1}Then the entrance to{3}Venus Lighthouse opened.{2}
They weren't in Venus{3}Lighthouse very long.{1}They were heading north{3}toward Babi Lighthouse{3}when I last saw them.{2}
I thought I recognized{3}one of them...{1}An alchemist who served{3}Babi... Was it Kraden?{2}
Kraden told them to stop,{3}but they attacked anyway.{1}Attacking scholars...{3}how vicious!{2}
Kraden went inside, but{3}then came back and said{3}this isn't the entrance.{1}But we've searched the{3}lighthouse, and there's{3}no other entrance.{2}
I thought I'd explore{3}after the door opened.{1}While I was searching{3}this room, Kraden and the{3}others appeared.{2}
They did something to{3}the statue that made{3}the floor light up.{2}
If Kraden hadn't been{3}there, we surely would{3}have been killed.{2}
Kraden said something{3}about this being the{3}exit...{1}I wonder what he's{3}discovered...{2}
I wonder what mysteries{3}the statue holds...{1}Kraden said the statue{3}indicated the true{3}path, but how?{2}
There are words carved{3}into the relief...{1}If ye seek to climb{3}Venus Lighthouse, first{3}seek the power within.{1}To obtain this power, see{3}with the eyes of truth.{3}Then the way shall open.{1}But the path I reveal is{3}not the beginning.{1}The true beginning lies{3}down ancient pathways{3}on distant soils.{2}
=
=
=
=
The true road can only{3}be known by he who bears{3}a true heart.{2}
The statue speaks to{3}{17}{1}'s soul...{1}Ye who seek to climb{3}Venus Lighthouse, I{3}shall grant thy wish.{1}The path long closed{3}shall not be opened here.{1}That path begins far,{3}far away, on the soil{3}of an ancient people,{1}with the sunrise to{3}your left as you gaze{3}upon the lighthouse.{2}
The statue speaks to{3}{17}{1}'s soul...{1}Ye who seek to climb{3}Venus Lighthouse must{3}seek the lady's leave.{1}Then the way shall open.{3}The lady will keep safe{3}at her feet{1}the place that you seek{3}as she awaits your{3}arrival.{2}
The statue speaks to{3}{17}{1}'s soul...{1}Ye who seek to climb{3}Venus Lighthouse, the{3}lady knows your desires.{1}Here, your path shall{3}not be opened.{2}
The statue seems to{3}speak to your soul...{2}
Red shines{3}northwest{3}of me.{2}
Yellow shines{3}northeast{3}of me.{2}
Red shines{3}due west{3}of me.{2}
Violet shines{3}southeast{3}of me.{2}
Violet shines{3}southeast{3}of me.{2}
Hmmm. We can't push the{3}block farther than this.{2}
It'd be great if we{3}could carry that block and{3}drop it to the ground.{1}Can our Psynergy help{3}us at all?{2}
It seems to be locked.{2}
More of Tolbi's soldiers{3}lay defeated...{2}
Is this more of{3}their work?{30}
That voice... It's{3}Iodem...{2}
You survived!{2}
We suffered great{3}losses...{2}
Were you fighting{5} a{3}group of six people?{2}
There were...{5}seven...{2}
You've survived as well!{2}
There were seven? Is{3}this the same group you{3}were following before?{2}
I'm certain of it.{3}One of them must have{3}been...{17}{7}.{2}
{17}{7}, you say...{3}Is this true!?{2}
The scholar Kraden was{3}protecting her. I'm{3}sure it was {17}{7}...{2}
Did you hear that, {17}{1}?{3}What do they want with{3}{17}{7}?{2}
{17}{7}... They all...{2}
Once they finished with{3}us, they headed for{3}Babi Lighthouse.{2}
What do they hope to find{3}at Babi Lighthouse?{2}
They spoke of the ruins{5}{3}beneath the lighthouse...{2}
Ruins? Of course!{3}The foundations of the{3}lighthouse!{2}
And Faran, the master{3}of the Lalivero, followed{3}them into the ruins...{2}
I see. Faran, too...{2}
{17}{1}! We must head for{3}Babi Lighthouse as well.{2}
Are you concerned{3}about these soldiers?{2}
We're fine...{3}You must hurry to{3}the lighthouse.{2}
The lighthouse... {17}{7}...{3}If anything happens...{3}Just hurry...{2}
Even the soldiers insist,{3}{17}{1}! Come on!{2}
{9}{4}Uhhnn...{7} We were{3}taken by surprise...{1}But why...{3}{17}{7}...{2}
They were terrible!{3}We were no match...{3}They're horrible!{2}
{9}{4}Ohh...{7} They took {17}{7}{3}and headed for the{3}ruins.{2}
{17}{7} is our only hope.{3}If something happens to{3}her, Lalivero is finished.{2}
This all happened because{3}Tolbi took {17}{7}{3}away from us...{2}
Faran followed {17}{7}.{3}I'm sure he'll{3}rescue her.{2}
The rumbling at the{3}ruins must have been{3}a warning...{2}
There was an earthquake{3}at the ruins before{3}this happened.{1}I wonder if {17}{7} and{3}the others are okay...{2}
If I were bigger, I{3}would have saved{3}{17}{7} myself!{2}
I bet {17}{7} can use{3}her powers to escape{3}them.{2}
We haven't been ordered{3}to start working yet...{3}Do we get today off?{2}
There were strange folk{3}going to the ruins...{3}Faran followed them.{2}
It's odd that Babi would{3}build a lighthouse in{3}a place like this.{1}Maybe he thought{3}using the ruins as the{3}foundation would be easy.{2}
Cutting these stones and{3}stacking them on the{3}ruins isn't easy.{1}Build it faster, you{3}say? Try building it{3}yourself, then!{2}
If only they didn't{3}have {17}{7}...{1}But even without her{3}as a hostage, we couldn't{3}have beaten them.{2}
They used fire on us!{3}That's just not right!{2}
Curses! We couldn't stop{3}{17}{7} and the others...{2}
What do they plan to do{3}with {17}{7} in the ruins...{1}No... I must not{3}think such horrible{3}things...{2}
We never should have{3}let Tolbi take {17}{7}{3}away from us.{2}
Faran still does not{3}return... What could{3}be happening?{2}
We have seen many omens{3}of bad things to come.{1}We saw one when {17}{7}{3}was taken from Lalivero,{3}too...{2}
The stones we stacked{3}for the lighthouse{3}won't fall, will they?{2}
I tried to step in front{3}of them to save her...{1}But my heart was{3}trembling...{3}I couldn't stop them...{2}
They all have a lesson{3}coming to them.{1}They'll learn why {17}{7}{3}is called the holy{3}child of Lalivero!{2}
There was a big fight{3}that ended in some{3}hostages being taken.{1}Tragic, I know, but{3}anything that gets me off{3}work can't be all bad!{2}
If Faran went after them,{3}then this is serious!{1}If this keeps up, we{3}won't be able to{3}build the lighthouse.{2}
Why would they want to{3}rush construction on{3}the lighthouse?{1}Maybe they hope to rule{3}the seas and control{3}more distant lands...{2}
Now that I think of it,{3}we did find a strange{3}cave in the quarry.{2}
Of course I have seen{3}{17}{7}{27} power...{3}It's incredible!{1}How could one with{3}such power ever be{3}taken hostage?{2}
There are some who do{3}not believe {17}{7}{3}has any powers...{1}Doubting {17}{7}?{3}That is foolish!{2}
Could Faran have{3}tricked us all?{1}If {17}{7} does have mystic{3}powers, she couldn't have{3}been taken hostage.{2}
If {17}{7} can't use her{3}powers in a time like{3}this, they're useless!{2}
{17}{7} came flying to{3}the ruins like a{3}shooting star.{1}She created a massive{3}depression in the{3}center of the ruins.{2}
Even {17}{7} couldn't{3}have escaped six of{3}them...{2}
They say a man named{3}Iodem is coming from{3}Tolbi.{1}I guess he plans to{3}make us do even{3}more work!{2}
No one's called me, so{3}maybe I'll take a nap...{2}
{17}{7} said the cave{3}at the ruins leads{3}to the southeast.{1}But it couldn't possibly{3}lead all the way to{3}Venus Lighthouse...{2}
The ruins that form the{3}lighthouse foundation{3}are riddled with caves.{1}If you could get through{3}the caves, I'm sure you'd{3}solve the ruins' riddle.{2}
We received {17}{7} from{3}the sky and raised her{3}lovingly...{1}I know Faran will{3}rescue that child.{2}
I just know that Father{3}will save my elder{3}sister, {17}{7}.{2}
His wife seems very calm,{3}considering.{1}Deep down, she must be{3}worried about {17}{7}.{2}
{17}{7}, if the power that you{3}showed us is real, then{3}please escape!{1}If you don't, I...might{3}start to doubt that{3}power of yours.{2}
{17}{7} is the savior{3}of Lalivero. There's no{3}mistake about it.{1}I don't know of anyone{3}other than {17}{7} with{3}power like that.{2}
A legendary savior{3}will appear in the sky...{1}I was a fool for believing{3}that savior was {17}{7}.{2}
I'd like to believe in{3}{17}{7}...{1}Please, {17}{7}, use your{3}power to escape from{3}them!{2}
Even though she fell{3}out of the sky, she{3}wasn't even bruised!{1}They can't hurt{3}{17}{7}!{2}
If something happens to{3}{17}{7}, what will become{3}of Lalivero?{2}
When Iodem gets here,{3}he's going to have{3}some explaining to do.{1}I wonder if I should{3}flee Lalivero...{2}
It's been so long since I{3}had a nap, I'd forgotten{3}how nice they are!{2}
I wonder how {17}{7}{3}knew about the caves{3}at the ruins?{1}Her visions...{3}they can't be true.{2}
Those caves are too{3}dangerous for me to{3}explore.{1}If only I were a warrior.{3}Then I'd go find the{3}treasure in the caves!{2}
It's so painful to{3}even think of anything{3}bad happening to {17}{7}.{1}I would take her place{3}if I could.{2}
I just wish someone{3}would please rescue my{3}sister, {17}{7}.{2}
That couple raised {17}{7}{3}as though she were{3}their own child.{1}When someone like {17}{7}{3}is kidnapped, it worries{3}us all!{2}
{17}{7} was taken{3}hostage, and Faran{3}went after them?{30}
Oh my! What's everyone{3}else in Lalivero doing?{1}If I didn't have to{3}watch my shop, I'd go{3}rescue {17}{7} myself!{2}
What are you, a shut-in?{3}That's all anyone{3}has been talking about!{2}
The Laliverans are a{3}timid people, so you can't{3}count on them here.{2}
You're a warrior, right?{3}Please rescue {17}{7}!{1}I'll give you a discount{3}on my goods if you{3}rescue her.{2}
I can't  rescue {17}{7}!{3}If I only had courage...{3}Maybe then...{2}
I guess it was people{3}from Angara who took{3}{17}{7} hostage.{1}Everyone knows that{3}continent is full of{3}thugs and barbarians.{2}
If anything happens to{3}{17}{7}...{1}I'll never do business{3}with anyone from{3}Angara again!{2}
If you want to stay, I'll{3}let you, because it{3}means money for me.{1}But if you're a warrior...{3}You ought to be{3}rescuing {17}{7}.{2}
Oh, I'm sorry...{2}
I'm so worried about{3}{17}{7}, I can't{3}concentrate.{2}
But no matter how much{3}I worry, there isn't{3}anything I can do.{2}
...Now, to work,{3}to work!{2}
Working like this{3}keeps my mind occupied.{2}
We must obey Tolbi...{3}That's what led to{3}this happening to {17}{7}.{1}Babi is responsible{3}for all of it!{2}
Why did this have to{3}happen to {17}{7}? If{3}only it were a dream.{2}
Housecleaning...{3}changing sheets...{3}It's all done, right?{1}I'm just not myself...{3}Sometimes I don't even{3}know what I'm doing...{2}
Once this incident is over,{3}I hope Tolbi's soldiers{3}all leave town...{2}
You mustn't keep{3}me from my work!{2}
Babi isn't building a{3}lighthouse{24}it's a{3}tower...{1}Maybe he is trying to{3}elevate himself to{3}the level of the gods.{2}
I bet Babi's tower{3}will be struck down!{1}After all, "pride{3}goeth before a fall!"{2}
Babi's most precious{3}belonging is kept here.{1}No one may enter!{2}
I wonder what Babi's{3}most precious{3}belonging is...{1}If I don't even know, how{3}can I be interested{3}in guarding it?{2}
They were{5} terrible!{3}We were absolutely{3}no match for them.{2}
Only two of those six{3}ever attacked anyone...{1}but just those two{3}completely overwhelmed{3}us!{2}
They just kicked us out{3}of their way and went{3}on to the lighthouse.{2}
They set fire to{3}everything! That's why the{3}ground is scorched.{1}Using fire as a{3}weapon is so cowardly!{2}
We're the ones who{3}attacked, but we took{3}all the damage.{1}What were we thinking,{3}trying to fight those{3}guys?{2}
The other four didn't{3}seem to have any fight{3}left in them at all.{2}
What could they be{3}planning for{3}Babi Lighthouse?{2}
None of them had{3}any torches.{1}It's like that{3}fire just appeared{3}out of nowhere!{2}
You're sure they went{3}through this door?{2}
Yes, they opened the{3}stone door and entered!{2}
Well? Does the door open?{2}
It's hopeless.{3}It won't budge...{2}
Of course not!{3}I told you, this{3}door doesn't open!{2}
If it did open, we would{3}have gone in long ago{3}to study the ruins.{2}
But I'm certain they{3}went through this door!{2}
And I'm saying no one{3}has ever gone through{3}here...{2}
Oh! Iodem...{2}
Faran!{2}
I am{5} so sorry about{3}{17}{7}...{2}
Why did this sort of{3}thing have to happen?{2}
Are {17}{5} and the{3}others beyond{3}this door?{2}
Yes. Beyond the door{3}that no normal man{3}can open...{2}
If they got through, then{3}we can, too. Right?{30}
Will you go for us?{2}
There is no one else{3}who can go after{3}them.{2}
Iodem, just who are{3}these people?{2}
They come from the far{3}north.{1}They have chased the ones{3}who took {17}{7} all{3}the way here.{2}
They've been chasing that{3}fearsome group?{2}
Yes. They are most{3}fearsome.{2}
Such awful power... And{3}what they're trying to{3}do seems very dangerous.{2}
We're the only ones who{3}can stop them.{2}
You think you can{3}stop them?{30}
You seem quite sure of{3}yourself, but what do you{3}think you can do?{2}
Hmph! Not with that{3}attitude, you can't!{2}
I have never heard such{3}harsh words from you,{3}Faran.{2}
What do you expect when,{3}in the midst of such{3}dangers...{1}you ask me to leave{3}{17}{7}'s fate in the{3}hands of children?{2}
If you want me to trust{3}them, they must give me{3}reason to trust them!{2}
First, you will have to{3}demonstrate your{3}powers to us.{2}
Can you follow the same{3}paths that they took?{30}
Your confidence means{3}nothing unless you show{3}that you can do it.{2}
Well, you have no choice...{3}You will have to try.{2}
Iodem asks only that{3}you stand back{3}and watch.{2}
Now, show me what you{3}can do.{2}
I am counting on you,{3}{17}{1}! Prove your worth{3}by opening that door!{2}
When I saw them, they{3}had already gone through{3}to the other side.{1}It's the truth!{3}You have to believe me!{2}
I am sorry, but not even{3}{17}{7} has ever passed{3}through here.{1}There is no way this{3}door will open.{2}
This all started when{3}{17}{7} was dragged{3}off to Tolbi.{1}If anything happens to{3}{17}{7}, the good folk of{3}Lalivero won't sit idly by!{2}
If you can open this door,{3}I will trust Iodem once{3}more...{2}
I do not mean to doubt{3}your abilities, {17}{1},{3}but I am very worried!{1}If this door doesn't{3}open...{2}
Nobody thinks the door{3}can be opened, and I'm{3}starting to doubt myself.{1}It's not like I{3}actually saw them go{3}through...{2}
I don't know what they're{3}waiting for. If they're{3}going to open the door,{1}they'd better{3}do it now!{2}
This is all a huge waste{3}of time!{1}If we don't find{3}{17}{7} soon, her life{3}may be in danger...{2}
I hope they can open the{3}door, but I won't believe{3}it until I see it.{2}
The door!{2}
I don't believe it!{3}The door opened!{2}
Incredible! It really{3}does open.{2}
How in the world did you{3}open the door?{2}
I don't know how to{3}explain it...{2}
We did it because{5}{5}{3}we're us!{2}
It would take too long{3}to explain.{2}
There's no time for{3}an explanation,{3}anyway.{2}
That's right. We must{3}rescue {17}{7}!{2}
Let's go, Faran. We've{3}got to save {17}{7}!{2}
Hey, the door's closing!{2}
Why did it close?{2}
I don't know...{3}Why does anything{3}close?{2}
It closed to prevent{3}people with no Psynergy{3}from entering!{2}
It would be perilous for{3}those without Psynergy to{3}try to get through.{2}
I agree! You'll have{3}to let us handle it{3}from here!{2}
What? You're telling us{3}to stay back?{30}
Since we can't even open{3}the door, we'd just be{3}getting in your way.{2}
It won't stop you, but if{3}we can't open the door,{3}we can't go with you.{2}
This is true...{2}
But we can't leave {17}{7}{3}in their hands just{3}because it's dangerous.{2}
They have greater power{3}than you can even{3}imagine.{2}
And without such power,{3}this door will not open{3}for us?{30}
That is how it seems.{2}
The power they just{3}displayed is but a fraction{3}of their true might.{2}
Without that sort of{3}power, we would just{3}get in their way.{2}
I understand. {17}{7}'s{3}life is in your hands.{2}
Do not fail us. You must{3}bring {17}{7} safely{3}back!{2}
Make haste, {17}{1}.{3}All our hopes lie with{3}you!{2}
I beg of you, {17}{1}.{3}Please bring {17}{7}{3}back!{2}
I can't believe this{3}door actually opened!{3}What are you?{2}
It takes great courage{3}to continue on in the{3}face of danger...{1}We will be here{3}awaiting your safe{3}return.{2}
I'm very interested in{3}what lies beyond here.{1}I know! Once this is{3}over, I'll go see{3}for myself!{2}
I am not afraid of{3}danger, but I do not{3}want to hinder you.{1}I am counting on you{3}to save {17}{7} for us.{2}
If anything happens to{3}{17}{7}, Tolbi will become{3}Lalivero's sworn enemy.{1}That must be{3}prevented at all costs.{2}
If this door opens, maybe{3}we can get into other{3}parts of the ruins too.{2}
I bet the monsters around{3}here are nothing{3}like what lies ahead!{1}I'm happy to leave such{3}dangers to these{3}warriors.{2}
This is a big waste{3}of time...{1}{17}{7}'s life is in{3}danger! If they don't{3}find her soon...{2}
I don't want to hinder{3}{17}{7}'s rescue!{1}From here on out,{3}I'm leaving everything{3}to these warriors...{2}
The truth of this door{3}is open to those seeing{3}with their true heart.{2}
At long last, the time{3}has come to light Venus{3}Lighthouse's beacon.{2}
With the second beacon{3}lit, only two will remain.{2}
No. Lighting Jupiter is{3}virtually the same as{3}lighting Mars.{2}
That is true. Jupiter is{3}really all that remains.{2}
That's right. Your dreams{3}are within your grasp{3}now.{2}
Why are you still here,{3}{17}{5}?{2}
I thought I ordered you{3}on ahead to the ship.{2}
I've already sent{3}{17}{6} and the others to{3}the dock at Idejima.{2}
Then why did you come{3}back?{2}
Because I have a{3}different promise to{3}keep.{2}
A promise, you say?{2}
You must mean {17}{7}...{2}
Yes, {17}{7}. Why haven't{3}you released her yet?{2}
You promised to free{3}her once you got into{3}Venus Lighthouse.{2}
And that's what brought{3}you back here?{2}
You promised not to{3}involve anyone who wasn't{3}related to this matter.{2}
{17}{7} is special.{2}
Of course...{2}
Because {17}{7} is a{3}special Adept?{2}
You guys learned{3}something from the{3}first two lighthouses.{2}
And what would that be?{2}
In order to enter each{3}lighthouse, you needed an{3}Adept of that clan.{2}
Right now, we have Fire,{3}Earth, and Water Adepts,{5}{3}but no Wind Adept.{2}
That does seem{5}{3}to be the case.{2}
Do we need {17}{7} to{3}get into the Jupiter{3}Lighthouse?{2}
I'm sorry, {17}{5}, but we{3}cannot even enter without{3}a Wind Adept.{2}
That being the case, I{3}guess I understand why{3}you can't set {17}{7} free.{2}
It seems that you, too,{3}have learned something.{1}If that is all, then{3}you should go, {17}{5}!{2}
No. I cannot leave{3}{17}{7} behind!{2}
I'm taking {17}{7}{3}to the ship!{2}
What are you talking{3}about, {17}{5}?{2}
We don't know what will{3}happen when you light this{3}beacon.{1}I won't leave {17}{7}{3}here to find out!{2}
We told you that we'd{3}protect {17}{7}. Don't{3}you trust us?{2}
That's not what I'm{3}saying...{5} It's just{3}best to be safe.{2}
Don't tell us what's{3}best, {17}{5}. You're{3}not taking {17}{7}.{2}
Why not?{5}{5} What?{5}{3}You don't trust me?{2}
How can we, after you{3}just demanded we free{3}{17}{7}?{2}
If we had trusted you{3}a moment ago, {17}{7}{3}would be free now.{2}
Come with me, {17}{7}!{3}I shall protect you!{2}
Are you ready to do{3}this, even though it{3}means fighting us?{2}
...I believe he is!{1}He would not have{3}defied us if he lacked{3}the will to fight.{2}
If it means protecting{3}{17}{7} from harm,{3}then I must.{2}
You have seen what{3}we can do. You know{3}you can't stop us.{2}
How can you protect{3}{17}{7}{5}, when you can't{3}even protect yourself?{2}
This rebellious attitude{3}is exactly why we've{3}never let you fight.{2}
Haven't you been given{3}enough reason to fear{3}us in these travels?{2}
You're no fighter, {17}{5}.{3}How can you hope to{3}stand against us?{2}
You've questioned us for{3}the last time!{5} Let's see{3}what you can do!{2}
It looks like they're{3}having a falling out{3}over {17}{7}.{2}
There's something more{3}to it, though...{2}
It seems Saturos and{3}Menardi no longer{3}trust {17}{5}.{2}
Looks like the perfect{3}opportunity has just{3}fallen into our laps!{2}
Now's our only chance to{3}prevent them from{3}lighting the beacon!{30}
There's not a moment to{3}spare!{5} Let's move!{2}
Don't chicken out now!{3}If we hesitate, they'll{3}light the beacon!{2}
{17}{1}...{2}
So!{5} You've come{3}to stop us?{2}
Look what your defiance{3}has brought us, {17}{5}!{2}
I don't need you or{3}anyone to rescue{3}me, {17}{1}!{2}
I was just about to{3}settle things with{3}Saturos and Menardi...{1}You can watch!{2}
And then we'll show you{3}the true power of this{3}beacon's light!{2}
But...{17}{7} has{3}nothing to do with this!{3}So set {17}{7} free!{2}
Silence!{5} You'd best tread{3}lightly, {17}{5}, or both{3}you and {17}{7} will suffer!{2}
If anything happens{3}to {17}{7}, we will have{3}failed Faran...{2}
We won't permit you{3}to lay a hand on{3}{17}{7} or {17}{5}!{2}
Oh ho! So you're{3}worried about {17}{7},{3}too?{2}
Don't worry. We won't{3}hurt {17}{7}...{5}if you{3}meet our conditions.{2}
What are you doing,{3}Saturos?{2}
Leave this to me!{2}
{17}{7}!{5} Do you{3}remember the rod{3}connected to Hesperia?{2}
The Rod of Hesperia?{2}
The rod required to{3}reach the Jupiter{3}Lighthouse!{2}
Ye{5}-Yes...{2}
Those who pursue us{3}bear a rod...{3}Is it the one?{2}
{17}{7}! Stay where you{3}are! You can do it{3}from there!{2}
How about it, {17}{7}?{2}
Well, {17}{7}?{2}
.{5}.{5}.{5}Perhaps{5}.{5}.{5}.{2}
"Perhaps..."{5}{3}Perhaps what!?{2}
Don't yell at her!{2}
We're not yelling!{5}{3}We just want a{3}straight answer.{2}
So, {17}{7}?{2}
Their minds are veiled.{3}I cannot see clearly...{5}but{3}I think...{5}it's the one.{2}
It's a waste to{3}make her try again.{2}
So, what do we do?{2}
Do you know the terms{3}we will require before we{3}agree not to harm {17}{7}?{30}
You're smarter than{3}I thought if you've{3}already figured it out.{2}
I want the rod that{3}will get us into{3}Jupiter Lighthouse.{2}
If you give us the{3}Shaman's Rod, {17}{7} will{3}not be harmed. Agreed?{30}
The Shaman's Rod?{5}{3}If it means saving {17}{7},{3}I will give it to you.{2}
He wants the Shaman's{3}Rod. If it will save{3}{17}{7}, I'll give it up.{2}
What?{5} But Hammet gave{3}that to you, {17}{3}!{2}
Don't you care{3}what happens to{3}{17}{7}?{2}
Then you will give{3}us {9}{2}the rod!{7}{2}
Well done, Saturos!{3}We finally have{3}the Shaman's Rod!{2}
Go get it, {17}{5}!{2}
Why me?{2}
To ensure your{3}loyalty to us!{2}
Go on, {17}{5}!{2}
{17}{1} handed over{3}the Shaman's Rod.{2}
What should I do{3}with the rod?{2}
Keep it safe!{2}
Where do you think{3}you're going, {17}{7}?{2}
We gave you the rod.{3}Now, release {17}{7}!{2}
Whatever do{3}you mean?{2}
You said you'd free{3}{17}{7} if we gave{3}you the rod.{2}
Those{5} were your terms.{2}
We gave you the rod,{3}so release {17}{7}!{2}
You seem to have{5}{3}misunderstood. I said we{3}wouldn't harm {17}{7}...{1}but I never said{3}we'd let her go!{2}
You're altering the{3}bargain?{2}
Ha ha! We can't help it{3}if you misinterpreted{3}Saturos's terms!{2}
Besides, if we were to{3}release {17}{7}, she'd{3}be in quite a fix.{2}
What do you mean?{2}
{17}{7} can't get{3}back to Lalivero{3}alone.{2}
What do you mean? We're{3}going to take{5} {17}{7}.{5}.{5}.{3}Oh no...{2}
That's right.{5} You{3}won't be going back.{3}This is it for you!{2}
Excuse me?{2}
Enough!{5} You're the{3}ones who aren't going{3}anywhere!{2}
Bring it on, whelp! You{3}won't live long enough to{3}regret your stupidity!{2}
Prepare to experience{3}first-hand the horror{3}of a master Fire Adept!{2}
We did it!{3}We beat 'em!{2}
All right, {17}{7}...{5}{3}Let's go!{2}
{17}{5}! What are{3}you doing?{2}
I cannot give up{3}{17}{7}...{2}
What!?{5} But we just{3}saved you!{2}
I never asked you{3}to help us...{2}
{17}{5}, you're not one{3}of them. You're free to{3}go now...{2}
So why are you{3}doing this?{2}
The four beacons must{3}still be lit...{2}
You're going to light{3}the beacons!? That's{3}ridiculous!{2}
I felt you'd say that.{5}{3}But{5} I'm going to do it{3}anyway!{2}
So, wait... If he means to{3}light the beacons, then{3}he's our enemy, right?{30}
Do what you will, {17}{1},{5}{3}but if you try to stop{3}me, I'll fight you.{2}
Friend or enemy, you{3}won't stop me from taking{3}{17}{7} with me!{2}
I hope{5} you don't{3}think{5} you've{3}finished us off.{2}
You may not be{3}finished, but you{3}can barely stand.{2}
Right now, {5}yes...{5}{3}But we'll be back{3}on our feet...{1}as soon as we do{3}{5}{5}THIS!{2}
Oh, no!{5} He threw{3}the Elemental Star{3}into the lighthouse!{2}
How could this happen...{3}We couldn't keep them{3}from lighting the beacon!{2}
That's not all...{2}
The energy of the{3}beacon will restore{3}our power.{2}
How can it restore{3}their power? Venus is the{3}earth elemental, right?{30}
Then why would Venus{3}give power to Fire{3}Adepts?{2}
Have you forgotten{3}everything we've learned?{3}Venus is earth.{1}It shouldn't be a{3}source of power{3}for Fire Adepts!{2}
Fire and earth share{5} a{3}symbiotic relationship.{2}
This light will restore{3}our Psynergy!{2}
We'll fight you as many{3}times as it takes.{3}We won't lose.{2}
You may have beaten{3}the two of us...{2}
But{5} now, you face the{3}true might of Fire{3}Clan of the north!{2}
Fire Clan of{3}the north?{2}
Bear witness to the{3}true strength of the{3}northern wilds!{2}
Oh, give it up!{3}We beat you once,{3}we'll do it again!{2}
Go, {17}{5}!{3}Take {17}{7} and go!{2}
I can...{5}go?{2}
We may not have the{3}strength to protect {17}{7}{3}after this.{2}
You must take {17}{7} to{3}the ship without fail!{2}
What are you waiting for?{3}Go! Now!{2}
No. I cannot leave{3}you to fight them{3}alone.{2}
Are you saying you{3}don't want to lose to{3}{17}{1}?{2}
I wonder if{3}that's true...{2}
What was that?{2}
Wouldn't you be just a{3}little sad to see your{3}childhood friend perish?{2}
What are you saying?{2}
I'm saying you're{3}here to protect this{3}brat from your past.{2}
Do you really think{3}that I{5} would help{3}them?{2}
Let's just say that{3}I wouldn't put it{3}past you.{2}
And you, Saturos?{5}{3}Do you agree?{2}
I wouldn't say that...{5}{3}But it would be best not{3}to raise our suspicion.{2}
Now, who's telling whom{3}what's best? Fine! I'll{3}take {17}{7} for you!{2}
Come on,{5} {17}{7}!{2}
Wait, {17}{5}! I won't{3}let you go!{2}
Heh heh... {17}{5} is the{3}least of your worries{3}right now.{2}
Oh my{24}{5}they're glowing!{2}
It's time you learned{5}{3}what true power is!{2}
Their Psynergy is{3}overflowing!{2}
Hya ha ha!{5}{3}It's too late{3}to run!{2}
Uh-oh...{3}They're fusing!{2}
They've merged into one{3}another! Everyone{3}get back!{2}
How...{5} How...{3}did we lose?{2}
We are superior in{3}every way{5}, but still{3}we were defeated...{2}
We did it! We won!{2}
We beat them...{5}but have{3}we really won?{30}
Even though we couldn't{3}stop the beacon from{3}being lit?{2}
All our efforts were{3}for naught.{2}
What are you{3}talking about?{2}
We did everything{3}we could!{2}
Sure we couldn't save{3}the Venus Lighthouse,{3}but...{2}
We beat them! They're{3}gone! You saw them fall{3}down into the pit...{2}
So we don't have to{3}worry about any more{3}beacons being lit!{2}
But {17}{5} is gone,{3}and he's taken {17}{7}...{2}
What's with you guys?{3}{17}{1}... What are you{3}lookin' at?!?{2}
{17}{5}!{2}
Did you{5}{5} finish them?{2}
No one knew their power{3}better than I did.{3}If you destroyed them...{2}
Then I am no match{3}for you now, {17}{1}...{1}I must go...{2}
Come, {17}{7}!{2}
Wait, {17}{5}!{2}
Why do you run from us?{2}
They fell into the{3}lighthouse. It's all{3}over!{2}
Poor fools...{5} If you think{3}it's over, you are{3}sadly mistaken!{2}
If you plan to light the{3}other beacons, you will{3}still need...{2}
The Elemental Stars?{3}We have them!{2}
They're gone, {17}{5}!{3}You don't have to light{3}the beacons anymore...{2}
Yes, I do.{5} If I don't{3}light the beacons...{2}
What will happen?{2}
It's no use talking{3}about it...{5}{3}Just wait and see!{2}
If you won't release{3}{17}{7}, we'll have{3}to take her back!{2}
The lighthouse...!{2}
{17}{1}!{5} They're too{3}far away! We can't reach{3}{17}{5}!{2}
That's not all! There's{3}light coming from{3}down below!{2}
Noooo!{5} {17}{7}!{2}
Hold on, {17}{7}!{3}Take my hand!{2}
I can't...{2}
You must try!{3}If you don't,{3}you'll fall!{2}
Look down...{5}{5} The{3}foundations of the{3}lighthouse are crumbling!{2}
Why is this happening?{3}Is it to protect{3}Venus Lighthouse?{2}
I'm{5} slipping...{5}{5}{3}I can't{5}{5} hold on{5} any longer.{2}
Nooo!{5} Don't let go!{3}You can't! You'll...{2}
Good-bye, {17}{5},{3}{5}{5}and thank you.{2}
{9}{2}{17}{7}!!!{7}{5} No!{3}I won't let you die!{2}
!!!{2}
{17}{7} fell after that{3}last tremor...{2}
{17}{5} didn't dive into{3}the sea after her,{3}did he?{2}
I can't believe he{3}did that from so{3}high up!{2}
You idiot, {17}{5}!{5} I can't{3}believe he said he'd{3}light the other beacons.{2}
We would have had to{3}fight him if this hadn't{3}happened...{2}
But he sacrificed{3}himself to save {17}{7}.{3}He's not like Saturos.{2}
I'm at a loss, {17}{1}.{3}We have to decide{3}what to do next.{2}
What to do?{5}{3}What {9}{2}can{7} we do?{2}
What about {17}{6} and{3}the others at Idejima?{2}
Oh yeah!{5} I completely{3}forgot about {17}{6}!{2}
{17}{1}! Listen up!{5} We've{3}got to find {17}{6}!{2}
Look at that!{5} {17}{1}{3}has finally come back{3}to his senses!{2}
Shouldn't we go find{3}{17}{6} and the others{3}right away?{30}
It's about time you{3}started agreeing with{3}me!{2}
{17}{1}, you'll have to tell{3}{17}{6} about {17}{5}.{2}
I know it will be hard,{3}but you'll be there to{3}comfort her.{2}
After all this, you don't{3}have the guts to tell{3}{17}{6} about {17}{5}?{2}
If you don't tell her{3}what happened to {17}{5},{3}then who will?{2}
You're going to have{3}to find a way to{3}console {17}{6}...{2}
What's the matter, {17}{2}?{2}
I was just thinkin'...{5}{5}{3}How the heck are we{3}supposed to get down?{2}
Good point.{5} This is{3}going to make leaving{3}very difficult...{2}
It's back to normal!{2}
That was odd...{3}What's going on{3}around here?{2}
I don't think we'll{3}ever know.{2}
At least now, we can{3}go search for {17}{6}{3}and the others.{2}
All right{5}, let's go,{3}{17}{1}!{5} It's time to find{3}{17}{6}.{2}
But despite a long and{3}tiring search, {17}{6} was{3}nowhere to be found.{2}
How did the search for{3}{17}{7} turn out?{2}
We were{5} unable to{3}find any sign of her.{2}
The seas are too rough{3}to search.{2}
And there's no sign{3}of her on land...{2}
Tolbi is responsible for{3}{17}{7}'s fate.{2}
No apology can reflect{3}the sorrow I feel at{3}your loss, Faran...{2}
All we can do for{3}{17}{7} now is...{3}hope.{2}
But tell me, what of{3}{17}{6} and the{3}others?{2}
The same. We've searched{3}all over, but they're{3}nowhere to be found.{2}
The ground tore apart{3}from the shock of the{3}lighthouse, and the ship...{2}
Apparently, everything at{3}Idejima, including the{3}ship, was swept away...{2}
So, Idejima itself{3}was washed out{3}to sea?{30}
Incredible... Then the{3}cave, too, has been{3}flooded?{2}
But we think {17}{6}{3}and the others are{3}still alive.{2}
They may have been{3}washed out to sea{3}with Idejima.{2}
We have decided to{3}continue searching for{3}{17}{6}.{2}
Haven't we,{3}{17}{1}?{30}
Do not worry about{3}{17}{7}. I just hope you{3}are able to find {17}{6}.{2}
You need not worry about{3}{17}{7}...{2}
We will find {17}{7}{3}without fail...{2}
{17}{7} has been in{3}dangerous situations{3}before and lived.{2}
But this time, I believe{3}it was nothing short{3}of a miracle...{2}
Who knew the sea would{3}rise up to the lighthouse{3}just as she fell?{2}
Can you really call{3}that a miracle?{2}
Do you think it was just{3}good luck?{2}
Let's call it mere{3}coincidence, for now.{2}
Nothing is coincidental{3}when it comes to this{3}child.{2}
So, you believe...{3}{17}{7} survived...?{2}
Yes. I am sure of it.{2}
Just because {17}{7}{3}...was an Adept?{2}
An Adept...{3}What is that?{2}
Well, it's...{2}
It's someone with abilities{3}like theirs.{2}
{17}{1}, you and your{3}friends are truly amazing.{2}
You were able to enter{3}the ancient ruins and get{3}to Venus Lighthouse.{2}
But {17}{7} was{3}different. She couldn't{3}enter the ruins.{2}
That's just because{3}{17}{7}'s abilities{3}are different from theirs.{2}
No matter how many times{3}I explain that to Faran...{3}He doesn't get it!{2}
{17}{2}, don't be rude...{2}
Unfortunately, we don't{3}have time to talk.{3}We've got to go!{2}
That's right. I didn't{3}mean to keep you...{2}
That didn't come{3}out right...{2}
We mean that while we're{3}talking, {17}{6} and the{3}others are lost at sea.{2}
I understand your{3}desire to leave as{3}soon as possible.{2}
The seas have been very{3}rough since the beacon{3}was lit. Be careful!{2}
You, too. Farewell.{2}
Take care...{3}and farewell!{2}
Thank you very much. I{3}hope your search for{3}{17}{7} yields success.{2}
But tell me, what of{3}{17}{6} and the{3}others?{2}
The same. We've searched{3}all over, but they're{3}nowhere to be found.{2}
The ground tore apart{3}from the shock of the{3}lighthouse...{2}
And then Idejima was{3}swept out to sea...{2}
My goodness... Then...{3}{17}{6} and the others{3}must have...{2}
{17}{5} said at the{3}lighthouse that he sent{3}{17}{6} ahead to the ship.{2}
But we think they{3}survived.{2}
They may have been{3}washed out to sea{3}with Idejima...{2}
So, we have decided to{3}continue searching for{3}{17}{6}.{2}
Haven't we,{3}{17}{1}?{30}
You will find {17}{6}.{3}I know it...{3}Farewell.{2}
Please wait for me{3}outside Faran's house.{3}I wish to speak with you.{2}
So, there are good folk{3}like {17}{1} and his{3}companions in Angara.{1}Ah... If only I were{3}younger... I would travel{3}to Angara myself...{2}
I must explain their{3}promise to Lord Babi,{3}before it's too late!{2}
Where are you going,{3}{17}{1}? Iodem asked us{3}to wait. Did you forget?{30}
We're going to need{3}to work on your memory,{3}{17}{1}.{2}
I know we need to leave,{3}but we should hear{3}what Iodem has to say.{2}
We can delay our{3}departure a little{3}longer. Let's wait.{2}
Thank you for waiting{3}for me.{2}
As you no doubt have{3}guessed, I need to speak{3}with you about Lemuria.{2}
Yes, the island of the{3}ancients far out{3}to sea.{2}
When you could not find{3}{17}{6}, you returned to{3}Venus Lighthouse.{2}
Yeah. The base of the{3}lighthouse was flooded,{3}so we couldn't get out.{2}
And that's when you{3}gazed out to sea, as you{3}promised Babi you would.{2}
Yes... And we saw an{3}area wrapped in mist.{2}
I remembered how Babi{3}said Lemuria was always{3}covered in mist.{2}
I am not sure, but I{3}am beginning to think{3}that may be Lemuria...{2}
If it is, then{3}Babi's life...{2}
...could be saved? Yes.{2}
Then I guess we have{3}no choice but to go...{30}
Good. Then it's settled.{3}I'll make arrangements for{3}you to leave at once.{2}
You swore an oath.{3}It is meaningless unless{3}you go immediately.{2}
But...we have to find{3}{17}{6} first...{2}
That is the other reason{3}I wanted to see you...{3}to give you this.{2}
Iodem takes out{3}the Black Orb.{2}
Oh, isn't that...{2}
You will need it to{3}sail Babi's ship.{2}
Babi told me the ship of{3}the ancients is an{3}incredible vessel.{2}
It will make your search{3}for {17}{6} easier.{2}
We appreciate it.{2}
But I want you to find{3}Lemuria as soon as{3}possible.{2}
We promised Babi we{3}would find Lemuria.{3}We will not fail him.{2}
{17}{1} got the Black Orb.{2}
The ship is docked at{3}the edge of town. You will{3}know it when you see it.{2}
Farewell! And bring back{3}news of Lemuria!{2}
Right on, {17}{1}!{3}We finally get to see{3}the ocean!{2}
To sea we go!{2}
It is time to depart.{2}
I thought the ship we saw{3}at Idejima was Babi's...{2}
His ship is here{3}in Lalivero.{2}
So the ship at the{3}peninsula was Saturos's{3}ship!{2}
Perhaps, but we have{3}no way of finding{3}that out now...{2}
Yes...{5} They're gone...{2}
But now we can sail{3}the ship of the ancients!{2}
It certainly will aid us{3}in our search for {17}{6}.{2}
Where are you going?{3}Aren't we taking{3}Babi's ship?{1}Then we should head to{3}that wharf the soldier{3}in town was guarding.{2}
I was told to let you{3}in if you showed up...{1}The door is open.{2}
Apparently, a ship has{3}been docked here all{3}this time...{1}It must be a very{3}special ship.{2}
This sure seems like a{3}strange place for Babi{3}to moor his yacht.{2}
Ha ha! I thought they had{3}done me in for sure,{3}but I'm all better now.{2}
I will never let my{3}guard down again.{1}We will be the ones to{3}protect Lalivero from{3}danger...{2}
Where could {17}{7} be{3}now? I'm so worried.{2}
Are you leaving{3}Lalivero?{30}
I do not know where you{3}are headed, but wherever{3}it is, you will do fine.{2}
You are staying?{1}Splendid! Me and all the{3}Laliverans will feel{3}much safer.{2}
I saw the beacon of{3}Venus Lighthouse{3}light up...{1}It was one of the most{3}beautiful sights I{3}have ever seen...{2}
The explosion in the{3}Venus ruins caused Babi{3}Lighthouse to crumble.{1}The works of man can{3}never withstand such{3}mystical power.{2}
The peninsula behind{3}Venus Lighthouse{3}is flooded...{1}The powers of the{3}ancients are fierce!{2}
I can't believe you{3}escaped Venus Lighthouse.{1}What? The tunnel under{3}the lighthouse is not{3}flooded? So that's how{1}you came back, huh?{2}
If you defeated that evil{3}bunch, you must be{3}mighty warriors!{2}
{17}{7} jumped into the{3}ocean from atop the{3}lighthouse? Unbelievable!{2}
No trespassing.{3}Danger beyond{3}this point.{2}
I am all healed now, but{3}I lost all my confidence{3}after being beaten.{1}Even if I return to{3}Tolbi, I will never{3}fight again.{2}
I wanted to be a part{3}of the battle at{3}Venus Lighthouse.{2}
If {17}{7} used her great{3}powers{5}, then she must{3}still be alive.{1}But surviving such{3}rough seas must be{3}very difficult.{2}
After everything that's{3}happened, Lalivero no{3}longer feels safe.{2}
Venus Lighthouse has been{3}the symbol of Lalivero{3}since the olden days...{1}The lighting of the beacon{3}may be a sign of good{3}things to come...{2}
Iodem of Tolbi doesn't{3}seem too disappointed{3}about Babi Lighthouse...{1}It must have just{3}been another whim of{3}that tyrant, Babi...{2}
The ocean is so rough{3}since the peninsula{3}was washed away.{1}They say one strange{3}event invites another...{3}leading to great disaster.{2}
Venus Lighthouse is{3}still standing strong{3}despite what happened.{1}It must have been{3}built by the gods...{2}
You must be great{3}warriors to defeat{3}them...{1}Can I become{3}your apprentice?{2}
{17}{7} would be fine{24}{3}even after falling from{3}such a height...{2}
The continent broke apart{3}around the lighthouse,{3}and the lands beyond it{1}are now far from the{3}continent of Gondowan.{3}Will they ever return?{2}
What happened to those{3}living on the other{3}side of the lighthouse?{2}
I shudder to think what{3}would happen if our town{3}was washed out to sea.{2}
We're lucky that we live{3}north of the lighthouse.{1}If we didn't, we{3}wouldn't have made it.{2}
Everyone says that{3}{17}{7} is okay...{3}Is that true?{2}
I realized how thoughtless{3}I was after what{3}happened...{1}Lalivero needs {17}{7}.{2}
If she is indeed the{3}child of the gods,{3}she will survive.{2}
We want to believe in{3}something at times{3}like this.{1}If we had {17}{7} now,{3}I could have relied on{3}her.{2}
{17}{7} should be fine.{3}She was fine when{3}she fell from the sky.{1}The height of the{3}lighthouse is nothing{3}to her!{2}
{17}{7} will wake when the{3}beacon in Venus{3}Lighthouse is lit.{1}Then, Lalivero will be{3}free from Tolbi's{3}grip...{2}
Seeing {17}{7} dive must{3}have been beautiful...{2}
I can't wait until{3}{17}{7} is back.{1}All of Lalivero is{3}awaiting her return.{2}
Babi Lighthouse crumbled{3}when all the lands shook.{1}No one can enter now{3}because it is too{3}dangerous inside.{2}
I always wanted a break,{3}but being on vacation{3}all the time is no fun.{2}
So the ruins really are{3}connected to Venus{3}Lighthouse. I knew it!{1}What {17}{7} said was{3}true!{2}
You finally solved{3}the mystery of the ruins...{1}I had no idea these ruins{3}were connected to{3}Venus Lighthouse.{2}
Will they continue on,{3}or quit now that Babi{3}Lighthouse has crumbled?{2}
I'm worried that we won't{3}get paid now that the{3}construction has ended.{2}
We can't possibly dig a{3}hole from here to Venus{3}Lighthouse.{1}It must have been very{3}difficult for those{3}who made this tunnel.{2}
The mystery of the{3}ruins should have{3}remained a mystery.{2}
Faran says knowing her{3}powers, {17}{7} is alive{3}without a doubt.{1}But I can't be as sure{3}as Faran until I see{3}her.{2}
You are leaving after{3}all, aren't you...{1}You are welcome in{3}Lalivero anytime.{2}
They say the lighthouse{3}crumbled down.{3}That's as it should be.{2}
You will find {17}{6}{3}someday. Farewell.{2}
{17}{1}, that boat belongs{3}to you now.{1}Do not hesitate to use{3}it any way you wish.{2}
I don't need fame or{3}fortune...{5} I just want{3}{17}{7} to be safe.{1}{17}{7}...{2}
Why won't anyone stop{3}{17}{1} and his friends{3}from leaving us?{2}
Tolbi is to be blamed{3}for what happened to{3}{17}{7}!{1}Tolbi should be{3}cursed and destroyed!{2}
So there are some people{3}like {17}{1} and his{3}friends in Angara...{1}If only I were a{3}little younger...{3}I'd go to Angara...{2}
Please use that ship to{3}find Lemuria, the land{3}that Lord Babi sought.{2}
I went to the ocean to{3}look for {17}{7} today,{3}but it was so rough.{2}
No one could{3}possibly swim in an{3}ocean that rough.{2}
We wanted to send ships{3}out to sea to find {17}{7},{3}but we can't yet.{1}The ships would{3}all capsize in the{3}rough waters.{2}
When will the ocean{3}be calm again?{2}
It is impossible to go{3}out on the ocean now. Be{3}careful when you do.{1}The Champa who rule the{3}seas are frightful{3}people. Beware.{2}
The Champa are people{3}from a coastal village{3}in Angara.{2}
I didn't know it at the{3}time, but that loud noise{3}was the sound of the{1}beacon being lit. The inn{3}guests all became{3}scared and ran outside.{2}
I must say, it is nice{3}to see the light of{3}the beacon at night.{2}
Fishing is so difficult{3}nowadays because the{3}ocean is so rough.{1}We have little to cook{3}when we can't fish.{3}That's no good for us!{2}
Why would the lighting{3}make such a loud{3}noise?{1}Was that the noise{3}of that star-like thing{3}above the lighthouse?{2}
I'm sleepy. These bright{3}nights have been keeping{3}me up late.{2}
Gee... What am I{3}going to cook{3}for dinner tonight?{2}
Babi Lighthouse was{3}struck down, just as I{3}knew it would be.{2}
First, the lighthouse was{3}struck down. Next, Babi{3}himself will be punished.{2}
It looks like it's{3}finally time to{3}leave Gondowan.{2}
It's so strange...{3}We've been traveling{3}for so long,{1}and yet it feels like{3}we've only just begun.{2}
Now that I think about{3}it, so many things{3}have happened.{2}
But our journey will be{3}over as soon as we{3}find {17}{6}, right?{30}
The end of one journey,{3}but the beginning of{3}another? No way!{2}
What did you say?{3}Our next journey?{3}What journey is that?{2}
You didn't forget,{3}did you, {17}{2}?{2}
Our promise to Babi.{2}
Oh... Lemuria!{2}
I wonder what kind of{3}place Lemuria is.{2}
We have to find{3}{17}{6} before going{3}to Lemuria, don't we?{30}
Yeah. That's important.{2}
Huh? {17}{6}'s going to be{3}very sad when I tell{3}her what you said!{2}
At any rate, this will{3}be our first time on{3}the ocean.{2}
So this is the ocean{3}Kraden wanted me to see.{2}
The seas are very rough.{3}Do you think we will{3}be okay?{30}
This is a Lemurian ship.{3}We'll be fine.{2}
I guess it's hard{3}to say. Still, we must{3}go, just the same...{2}
Well... Shall we, then?{2}
To sea...{2}
{17}{6} is waiting{3}for us!{2}
Oh, Kraden... How long{3}will this island{3}continue to drift?{2}
I don't know...{3}I wish you could{3}tell me.{2}
Sheesh... You're no help{3}in times like this.{2}
Hey, I'm hungry...{2}
How can you think{3}about food?{2}
I wonder what{3}happened to my{3}brother...{2}
I can't be certain,{5} but{3}it looks like they lit{3}the Venus beacon.{2}
You don't have to tell me{3}that. That's how we wound{3}up adrift at sea, right?{2}
You are so cranky{3}today, {17}{6}!{2}
Well,{5} I suppose you{3}must be worried about{3}{17}{5}.{2}
{17}{1} and his friends{3}must have been{3}nearby, too.{2}
They probably were...{2}
I miss them...{3}{17}{1}...{3}{17}{5}...{2}
There is something I{3}wish to show you.{2}
Walk this way.{2}
{17}{5}... {17}{7}...{30}
{17}{5}! {17}{7}!{30}
They... {5}They're alive.{2}
They're alive!{2}
What is this?{3}Alex, what happened?{2}
The link was{3}disconnected.{2}

Unbelievable!!! The next{3}monster is beyond your{3}imagination!{1}You will fight, won't{3}you?{30}
I can't wait, {17}{1}!{3}Let's go get 'em!{2}
Yes. I'll always help{3}{17}{1} in battle!{2}
I'll do my best!{2}
?
Where are you{3}taking me?{2}
Hey, {17}{1}, are you{3}going to fight alone?{1}You've got to be{3}kidding.{2}
Oh... I should sit{3}this one out?{1}Okay...{3}I'm a little{3}disappointed.{2}
Oh.. I shouldn't fight,{3}huh?{1}Then I will be hoping{3}for everyone's safety.{2}
?
Go get 'em!{2}
Hey, are you trying{3}to get away from it?{1}Well... I will win{3}on my own. Just watch!{2}
What? {17}{1}? You are{3}not going to fight?{2}
I will do my best to{3}cover {17}{1}'s share.{2}
?
Don't be lazy!{2}
I wonder who the next{3}opponent is... I can't{3}wait. Right, {17}{1}?{2}
I will do my best, but{3}can you cover me when{3}I need it, {17}{1}?{2}
I should be able to{3}win against anyone.{2}
?
I am going to win!{2}
Hmm. I will just{3}watch how you fight,{3}then.{2}
I am...a bit relieved.{2}
I hope my prayers{3}will be heard...{2}
?
Go get 'em!{2}
Yeah! We won! See?{3}I told you, you can{3}count on me!{2}
We managed to win...{3}Was I any help?{2}
For a second, I thought{3}we'd lost. But we won!{1}My prayers were{3}heard indeed!{2}
?
We won!{2}
What? You won{3}without me?{1}Well, you would have{3}won faster if you{3}had me around!{2}
Wow, {17}{1}.{1}I could watch{3}without any worries.{2}
You came back{3}safe and sound!{1}My prayers must{3}have been heard!{2}
?
You won?{2}
{17}{1}, it's not my{3}fault we lost.{1}We need to work on our{3}teamwork. Let's try{3}harder next time!{2}
I'm sorry we lost.{1}I think they read{3}our game plan.{2}
Maybe I am not{3}so good in battle...{2}
?
We lost!{2}
I knew it. You lost{3}because you left{3}me out!{2}
I... I am glad{3}that I didn't go to{3}the battle.{2}
My prayers{3}were not heard...{2}
?
Oh, no. We lost...{2}
It looks like this is{3}your first time here.{1}I will teach you{3}what it is like to{3}fight in a battle.{2}
You've won {22}{3}Linked Battle{25}. Keep up{3}the good work!{2}
It looks like this is{3}your first time here.{1}You can ask me about{3}the results of your{3}battle. Okay?{2}
You've won {22}{3}Linked Battle{25}.{1}Check the board on{3}the wall for the best{3}records so far.{2}
Up to three allies{3}can fight in Linked{3}Battle finals.{1}The results vary greatly{3}depending on who you{3}set what Djinn to.{2}
That was a great{3}battle..{3}What excitement!{2}
Too bad. Sometimes, you{3}have to be lucky to win.{3}Don't be too disappointed.{2}
Is this the Battle Arena{3}the old man spoke of?{3}I thought it was a{1}story of dreams. Or is{3}this the old man's{3}dream?{2}
Wow... You guys.{3}You are much stronger{3}than you look.{2}
What happened, you guys?{3}Try harder.{2}
I am a traveling warrior.{3}I came here to become{3}stronger...{1}Listen to me on{3}this: Don't underestimate{3}the monsters here...{2}
You aren't too bad.{3}But don't become too{3}arrogant from this{1}victory. Continue to{3}train yourselves.{2}
You have to train more.{1}Put your heart into{3}it when you fight.{2}
I will tell you your{3}total wins when you{3}finish the linked finals.{2}
I will tell you your{3}consecutive wins when{3}you finish the finals.{2}
You've won {22}{3}consecutive Monster{3}Battle{25}.{1}Keep up the good work!{2}
I can't wait to see how{3}many Monster Battles{3}you win.{1}I'll be counting{3}your victories!{2}
Up to three allies{3}can fight in the{3}linked finals.{1}There are four in your{3}party, so the rightmost{3}ally will have to pass.{2}
Up to three allies{3}can fight in the{3}linked finals...{1}So all of you can{3}fight!{2}
You can change the order{3}of your party in the{3}status screen.{1}But you knew that, right?{2}
In the linked finals, you{3}can't delay after your{3}opponent selects a move.{1}If you don't choose your{3}command within 15 seconds,{3}you automatically defend.{2}
Monster Battle rules say{3}you all must fight as a{3}team against a monster.{1}If you're fighting as a{3}team, you can use the{3}same tactics...{1}you used in your travels.{2}
To use Summon quickly,{3}Djinn must be on{3}standby.{1}But to improve your class,{3}Djinn must be set...{3}Hmm... Choices, choices...{2}
Do you put Djinn on{3}standby before a battle,{3}or do you set them?{1}I usually set them to{3}raise my class before{3}I fight.{2}
Remove Djinn you rarely{3}use so you can{3}summon quickly.{1}I'm impatient, so I{3}prefer to fight in{3}short battles.{2}
All the warriors are{3}impressive, so I get edgy{3}before battles begin.{2}
I could enter, but I'd{3}just get hurt if I{3}did... That'd be stupid.{2}
Looks like egg soup.{1}Soft eggs are key{3}to its flavor.{2}
Fresh omelettes!{1}Bilibino omelettes use{3}Wild Mushrooms{3}caught in the area.{2}
There's a book{3}entitled "All About Items."{1}According to the book,{3}there are many unknown{3}items in the world.{2}
It looks like porridge.{1}It is the best thing{3}when you're sick!{2}
It's some hot stew.{1}It warms the body {9}{2}and{7}{3}the soul.{2}
They're making stir-fry.{1}The cabbage looks{3}strangely appetizing.{2}
It's the Xian Gourmet,{3}the best in the world!{1}It looks so appetizing,{3}it's hard to imagine{3}how good it tastes.{2}
They're steamed dumplings.{1}They're great piping{3}hot!{2}
{17}{1} and his friends{3}are shocked!{1}They've never seen{3}ingredients like that!{2}
He's making{3}hot bean curd.{1}Tastes good with rice...{2}
There are many{3}chopsticks...{1}but not a single spoon{3}can be seen.{2}
There are medicinal{3}herbs.{1}They have special{3}scents.{2}
There's a kimono.{1}It looks like a{3}nightgown for guests{3}staying at the inn.{2}
It's just a sales report.{1}It has lots of{3}numbers in a line.{3}Looks boring.{2}
The pots and pans{3}are rusted...{2}
He is making{3}roast beef.{1}Even the peppers{3}look appetizing!{2}
He is making{3}shrimp in a chili sauce.{1}The shrimp looks so{3}scrumptious...{3}My mouth is watering.{2}
There is a book titled{3}"Altin: The Mining{3}Village."{1}Altin mines are famous{3}for their beautiful gems,{3}according to the book.{2}
She's toasting some bread.{1}It smells great.{2}
